Question 1: Short Answer Secondary Source 

3  points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE  economic development that would support Biran’s argument  in  the passage  
regarding the Mongols and the  “integration of the old world.”  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The stability and size of the Mongol Empire led to the expansion of the silk road trade. 
•  Many cities in Afro-Eurasia grew larger and wealthier. 
•  Merchants could travel vast distances across Afro-Eurasia easier and more safely 

under Mongol rule. 

(B) 

Explain  how  ONE piece of  evidence would  challenge  Biran’s argument regarding the 
Mongols and  “the first chapter of a new era.”  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The new era only began when connections between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas 

were established. 

•  The Mongol period only saw an expansion of previously existing trends in earlier 

decades and centuries. 

•  The Mongol conquests destroyed as much as they benefitted peoples of 

Afro-Eurasia.

(C) 

Explain  how  ONE intercultural transfer  or exchange resulted from the Mongol conquests.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Under the support of Mongol rulers, religions, such as Islam or Buddhism, spread. 
•  Mongol conquests in Eurasia led to Mongol adoption of local religions and political 

practices. 

•  The Mongol unification of regions from China to the Middle East to Europe led to the 
spread of technologies, such as gunpowder, and pathogens, such as the plague. 
•  Mongol rule brought Islamic geographic, mathematical, and scientific knowledge to 

China.

Short Answer Question 1 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to analyze a secondary source document related to the role 
and impact of the Mongols in the period 1200–1450. In part A students were asked to identify one 
economic development that supported the author’s argument about Old-World integration. In part B 
the students were asked to explain how one piece of evidence challenged the notion that Mongol 
expansion marked a new era. Finally, in part C students were asked to explain how one intercultural 
transfer or exchange resulted from Mongol conquests. This question primarily addressed Topics 2.1, 
2.2, and 2.5 of the AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

Sample: 1A 
Score:  3  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying that the Mongols provided protection for merchants 
traveling on trade routes allowing for the transfer of goods and culture. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how later European maritime exploration was more 
worthy of being the start of a new era than the Mongol conquests. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining how goods, ideas, and religion, including Christianity 
and Islam, were spread due to Mongol protection of trade routes across Eurasia. 

Sample: 1B 
Score:  2  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying that the Mongols “made the silk roads safer than ever, 
facilitating more and longer-distance trade.” 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how “Mongol violence and brutality counters the 
argument that they led to world integration.” 

c) The response did not earn the point because while it addresses Mongol support for trade, it does not 
explain an intercultural exchange or transfer. 

Sample: 1C 
Score:  1  

a) The response did not earn the point because the invention and use of the lateen sail are not related 
to Mongol conquest and expansion. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how the discovery of the Americas was the start of a 
new era, which challenges Biran’s argument. 

c) The response did not earn the point because although it identifies that the Mongols took control over 
China, it does not explain the intercultural transfer or exchange.
