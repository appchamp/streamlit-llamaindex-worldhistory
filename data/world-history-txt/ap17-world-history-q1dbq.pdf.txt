A

Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a 
historically defensible claim and 
responds to all parts of the question. 
The thesis must consist of one or more 
sentences located in one place, either 
in the introduction or the conclusion. (1 
point) 

Argument Development: Develops 
and supports a cohesive argument that 
recognizes and accounts for historical 
complexity by explicitly illustrating 
relationships among historical evidence 
such as contradiction, corroboration, 
and/or qualification. (1 point) 

Notes 
•  Acceptable thesis statements must EXPLICITLY 
address a difference between at least one aspect 
of religious responses and at least one aspect of 
state responses to wealth accumulation in 
Eurasia during the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 1500 
C.E. 

Commonly seen examples might include:  

•  Religious and state responses to wealth 

accumulation differ in that religious responses 
encouraged the rejection of wealth to obtain 
salvation or create harmony, while state 
responses were to regulate the accumulation of 
wealth through administrative functions or 
state sponsored hierarchies. 

•  States responded to wealth accumulation by 

creating bureaucracies and laws that protected 
trade. This differed from religious responses 
which encouraged the wealthy to redistribute 
wealth and strengthen the religious 
organization.   

•  Students earn the point by noting that there are 
a variety of state and religious responses to 
wealth accumulation, while also corroborating 
the thesis statement or overarching argument 
consistently and cohesively throughout the 
essay with multiple pieces of evidence.

Question 1 — Document-based Question (continued) 

Document Analysis (Content): 
Utilizes the content of at least six of the 
documents to support the stated thesis 
or a relevant argument. (1 point) 
Document Analysis (Sourcing): 
Explains the significance of the 
author’s point of view, author’s 
purpose, historical context, and/or 
audience for at least four documents. (1 
point) 

Contextualization: Situates the 
argument by explaining the broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes immediately relevant to the 
question. (1 point) 

See document summaries for details. 
•  Doc. 1: The Chronicle of Zuo, ca. 350 B.C.E. 
•  Doc. 2: Chanakya, Arthashastra, ca. 250 B.C.E. 
•  Doc. 3: Cicero, Essay about Duties, ca. 50 B.C.E. 
•  Doc. 4: Gerontius, Life of Melania, ca. 450 C.E. 
•  Doc. 5: The Qur’an 
•  Doc. 6: Bezeklik Buddhist painting, ca. 800 C.E. 
•  Doc. 7: Ganapatideva, edict, ca. 1245 C.E. 

Commonly seen examples might include:  

•  Content (Doc. 1): The Chronicle of Zuo allowed 
Chinese merchants to accumulate as much 
wealth as possible so long as they didn’t try to 
topple the ruler. 

•  Sourcing (Doc. 1): It makes sense that Doc. 1 

would allow merchants to gain a lot of wealth in 
an attempt to preserve the political power of 
the ruler. The climate of fear at this tumultuous 
time likely caused the government to be more 
accepting of rich traders. 

•  Content (Doc. 4): The life of Melania the 

Younger shows that Christianity encouraged 
successful merchants to give away their wealth 
to the needy and to monasteries, as was done 
by this saint. 

•  Sourcing (Doc. 4): Because the purpose of the 

biography was to tell a positive story about the 
life of Melania, Doc. 4 likely exaggerated the 
amount of wealth given away by the saint. 
This point can be earned by explaining historical 
events, developments, or processes that occur 
before, during, or continue after the time frame of the 
question.  
Commonly seen examples might include:  

•  The rise of empires and the development of 

imperial administrations. 

•  The rise and spread of religions; foundational 

beliefs regarding salvation and living “the good 
life” of major religious traditions. 

•  The growth of interregional trading networks 
across Afro-Eurasia and corresponding rise in 
the economic and social prominence of 
merchants.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
historical documents. This DBQ asked students to evaluate the extent to which states and religions 
differed in their views regarding wealth accumulation in both the classical and post-classical eras. The 
question addressed Key Concepts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of the AP World History Curriculum 
Framework (The Development and Codification of Religious and Cultural Traditions; The Development of 
States and Empires; Emergence of Interregional Networks of Communication and Exchange; Expansion 
and Intensification of Communication and Exchange Networks; Continuity and Innovation of State Forms 
and Their Interactions; and Increased Economic Productive Capacity and Its Consequences). The seven 
documents provided students with opportunities to examine both religious views of wealth accumulation 
(with documents representing Confucian, Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist views) and state views of 
wealth accumulation (with documents representing Warring States China, the Mauryan Empire, the 
Roman Empire, and a thirteenth-century South Indian kingdom). As part of their responses, students had 
to present a historically defensible thesis; develop a cohesive argument that accounts for the historical 
complexities of the question; utilize the content of at least six documents in support of the thesis or a 
relevant argument; explain the significance of authorial purpose, point of view, the document’s historical 
context, or its intended audience for at least four documents; situate the argument in a broader historical 
context; provide at least one example of specific evidence not mentioned in the documents to support or 
qualify the argument; and extend the argument by either connecting it to a different course theme or 
another discipline or by comparing it to developments in other regions or time periods. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 7 

The essay earned the thesis point in the first paragraph with a clear description of differing religious and 
state responses to wealth accumulation. 

The essay earned the argument development point for accounting for historical complexity by consistently 
corroborating the argument with evidence from the documents and with outside evidence as well. For 
instance, the essay uses specific examples from documents 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as the main supporting evidence 
for the thesis, but also supplements that evidence by citing other examples such as the senatorial domination 
of the latifundia in ancient Rome, the Red Turban rebellion in fourteenth-century China, and the Bolshevik 
Revolution in the early twentieth century. 

By applying information drawn from each of the documents in support of an argument, the essay earned the 
document content utilization point   

The essay earned the document sourcing point by explaining the significance of the sourcing of documents 
1, 2, 4, and 5. The analysis of document 2 is based on the intended audience. The analysis of documents 1 
and 5 is based on the historical context. The point of view of document 4 is explained through an analysis of 
the document’s tone. 

The essay earned the contextualization point by discussing wealth generation and class struggles in the Han 
and Roman empires as well as the applicable Buddhist and Islamic beliefs in the second paragraph. 

The essay earned the evidence beyond the documents point in the explanation of the Arthashastra and 
comparison to Qin legalism on page 2 as well as the discussion of the Five Pillars of Islam on page 3. 

The discussion of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia as a reaction to the accumulation of wealth in the hands 
of the few as a result of industrialization earned the synthesis point.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 4 

The essay earned the thesis point in the last two sentences of the first paragraph with a comparison of 
religious and state responses to wealth accumulation. 

The essay did not earn the argument development point because even though it provides specific evidence 
from the documents and from outside the documents to support an argument, that evidence does not always 
fully substantiate an argument or account for historical complexity. For example, the essay’s analysis of the 
Qur’an is accurate, but it does not explicitly explain why that evidence demonstrates that people became 
more loyal to religion than the state. In addition, the essay’s claim that Cicero wrote his treatise to “show 
how the government is bad for the people” is a misreading of the document and, therefore, does not support 
the thesis. 

The essay did not earn the document content utilization point because only information drawn from 
documents 1 and 6 is applied to support the argument. 

The essay earned the document sourcing point by successfully explaining the purpose of documents 1, 2, 4, 
and 5 as well as the significance of that purpose in each case. 

The essay earned the contextualization point in the first four sentences of the first paragraph, where it 
discusses the rise of religions and bureaucratic systems and their methods of wealth collection. 

The essay earned the evidence beyond the documents point with the discussion in the middle of the second 
page, but the discussion at the bottom of the third page could also have earned the point. 

The essay does not attempt and did not earn the synthesis point. 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

The essay earned the thesis point at the end of the first paragraph with an adequate statement of a 
difference between religious and state responses. 

The essay did not earn the argument development point because it does not account for historical 
complexity. The essay cites evidence from all of the documents to support its position, but the evidence and 
its connections to the thesis are not always explained. In addition, the essay does not use outside evidence 
to corroborate its interpretation of the documents and also does not acknowledge complexities within the 
documents. 

The essay did not earn the document content utilization point because information is drawn from only 
documents 4, 5, and 6 to support the argument. Documents 2, 3, and 7 are misread. 

The essay did not earn the document sourcing point because analysis or sourcing of the documents is not 
attempted. 

The essay does not attempt and did not earn the contextualization point. 

The essay does not attempt to provide evidence beyond the documents, and so it did not earn the point.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

The essay attempts synthesis in the final paragraph, but it did not earn the synthesis point because the 
essay does not explain how the example provided is connected to religious or state responses to wealth 
accumulation in premodern Afro-Eurasia.
