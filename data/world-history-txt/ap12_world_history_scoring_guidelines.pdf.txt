Question 1 

BASIC CORE (competence)    

1.  Has acceptable thesis 

      0–7 Points 

          1 Point 

•  The thesis must address a specific relationship between cricket and politics in 

South Asia, using evidence from the documents. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified  

conclusion  of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis cannot be counted for credit in any other category.  

2.  Understands the basic meaning of documents    
•  Students must address all 10 of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least nine 

                1 Point 

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to a specific relationship between cricket and politics. 

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without context 

does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document 

   2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of the relationship between cricket and politics 

must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine documents.  

•  Simply listing a document does not count as using the document as evidence.  

     For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of the relationship between cricket and politics 

must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents. 

•  Simply listing a document does not count as using the document as evidence.  

4.  Analyzes point of view in at least two documents   

          1 Point 

Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 
•  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular opinion, 

or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining a document’s tone, the 
characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion.  

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but 

must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing some 
plausible analysis.  

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.

subgroup. 

•  Students may not receive credit for both the larger group and the subgroups within 

it.   

•  Groupings must address with coherence the specific relationship between cricket 

and politics. Examples include:
