General Scoring Notes 

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those 
errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the 
content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or why 

a relationship exists.

Short Answer Question 3 

Overview 

Students were asked to identify one continuity in the political system of China in the period 1200–1750. They 
then were asked to identify one change in the political system of China in the period 1200–1750. And, lastly, 
they were asked to explain one way in which political continuities in China influenced the development of the 
global economy in that same period. The question primarily addressed Topics 1.1., 2.1., and 4.4. of the AP 
World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying Confucianism as a political continuity in the period 1200–1750. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying the brief stoppage of the civil service exam in China due to 
reforms in the period 1200–1750. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining that state-sponsored activity such as the Chinese government’s 
involvement in the voyages of Zheng He, the protection of the Silk Roads, and the construction of the Grand 
Canal influenced the development of the global economy. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 2 

a) The response did not earn a point because the discussion of China’s communist government is outside of 
the specified time period. 

b) The response earned 1 point by identifying the “momentarally getting rid of the civil service exam during the 
Mongols rule” as a change in the political system in China. 

c) The response earned 1 point by explaining that China’s government “wanted silver” and the trade that 
continued “boosted the economy overall.” 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the civil service exam as a political continuity in the period 
1200–1750. 

b) The response did not earn a point because the explanation refers to Mao Zedong, whose rule falls outside 
the time period. 

c) The response did not earn a point because the explanation does not address a political continuity that 
influenced China’s role in global trade.
