Question 1: Document-Based Question, Imperialism and Asian and African economies  

7 points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 
nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to 
advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.  

Evaluate the extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

about the great extent to which European imperialism 
disrupted or even destroyed some African economies) 
(Document 6): “Ndansi Kumalo’s account shows the 
devastation of traditional African economies by imperialism, 
by relating how the Ndebele were forced into wage work for 
the White settlers in mines and farms, where they were 
subjected to high taxes.”  (Connects the content of the 
document to an argument about the extent to which 
imperialism transformed and disrupted traditional African 
economic activities)

Uses at least one additional piece of the specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the 
documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt. 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 
Responses that earn this point: 
•  Must use at least one specific piece of historical evidence relevant to an argument about the 

extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or Asia in the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 

Examples of specific and relevant evidence beyond the documents that earn this point include 
the following if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  British investment projects, such as the building of railroads in India and Africa 
• 
•  Economic modernization initiatives taken by Asian and African states, such as the Meiji 

Large-scale European-driven infrastructure projects, such as the building of the Suez Canal 

Restoration in Japan 

•  The forced expulsion of ethnic groups from traditional land, such as during the Herero 

genocide or the displacement of Arab and Berber populations in French Algeria 

•  The use of military force to require Asian and African states to alter their trading patterns, such 

as during the Opium Wars 

Examples of evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument about the prompt: 
• 

“The British opium trade in China eventually led to the Opium wars, during which Britain used 
its military to force China to agree to unequal trade agreements.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument about the prompt) 
“Local elites often cooperated with European forces for their own benefit, even though those 
agreements did not necessarily benefit their subjects. For instance, Egypt cooperated with 
France and Britain to build the Suez Canal, but many Egyptian workers suffered and died during 
the construction.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in the documents relevant to an argument 
about the prompt)

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.  
•  To earn this point, the evidence provided must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization. 
•  To earn this point, the evidence provided must be more than a phrase or reference.

historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the 
three documents sourced.  

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 
• 

(Document 1): “The author of Document 1 was a manager of a Dutch-government-owned sugar factory in 
Indonesia. As a manager, it would have been his duty to report to his superiors about the damage that the 
Dutch Cultivation System has inflicted on the availability of Indonesian labor for his factory.” (Connects the 
point of view of the author to an argument about the negative influence of Dutch imperial policies on the 
economy of Java)   

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose:  
• 

(Document 7): “The purpose of the account is to document the cruelty of the Germans and the economic 
hardships placed on Africans working on the cotton plantations. Because the account was given to African 
historians after Tanzania became independent, they would likely have wanted to emphasize the negative 
aspects of European imperialism.” (Connects a plausible speculation regarding the purpose of the source 
to an argument about the extent to which European imperialism affected African economies) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: 
• 

(Document 4): “The Ndebele ruler, whose territory was probably under a lot of pressure from White 
settlers as well as from neighboring African groups, likely thought that he had no choice but to trade away 
the right to mine raw materials in his country to the English in exchange for guns and a steamboat with 
which he could defend himself.” (Connects the historical situation of the document to an argument about 
an economic change in Africa brought about by European imperialism)

Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using 
evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. 

Complexity 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point:  
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple 

causes, or explaining both causes and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. 
•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. 
•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following if appropriate elaboration is 
provided: 
•  Analyzing multiple variables, such as considering diverse or alternate perspectives or evidence. For 

example, a response may explore multiple economic impacts of European imperialism on native societies, 
including physical exploitation of native labor, collapse of traditional economic activity, restructuring and 
realignment of elites, changes to gender roles as a result of new economic demands, etc. (Explains 
nuance) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space. For example, a response may 

compare the effects of European imperialism seen in Documents 4 and 6 with the effects of imperialism in 
other colonial settings where large numbers of White settlers encroached on the territories of native 
peoples—such as in Australia or Algeria. Or a response may compare the exploitation of native labor for 
the extraction of resources, as seen in Documents 1, 5, and 7, with the exploitation of native labor 
through indirect imperialism in Latin America through forced labor systems such as indenture and debt 
servitude. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as explaining how European imperialism’s economic effects 
were complex and affected different segments of Asian and African societies in different ways. For 
example, a response might argue that, in addition to its destructive or disruptive economic effects, 
European imperialism in some cases benefitted parts of native societies through increased trade 
(Document 3), limited economic modernization (Document 1), strengthening of native elites  
(Document 4) or economic recovery after the initial disruption (Document 6). (Corroborates, qualifies or 
modifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

•  Reports on the negative effects of the 

imposition of the Dutch Cultivation System 
on the availability of Javanese labor for the

the Cultivation System, Javanese workers 
are subject to multiple labor demands, and

offering good wages.

The graphs show divergent trends for 
Indian textile exports to Britain and British 
textile exports to India: Indian exports to 
Britain are declining while British exports to 
India are rising. The drop in Indian exports 
to Britain is particularly sharp for the calico 
and muslin cloth category, while the rise in 
British export to India is particularly great 
for the plain cotton cloth category. 
States that the growing trade between 
India and Britain has led to an expansion of 
Indian agriculture, as India has become an 
exporter of agricultural commodities to 
Britain. Acknowledges that the Indian 
cotton industry has collapsed because of 
cheap British cloth imports but suggests 
that the collapse can be managed by Indian 
weavers being more open to adopting 
other trades, such as cultivating rice. 

Explains the relevance of point of view (POV), purpose, situation, and/or 
audience by elaborating on examples such as: 

• 

• 

The author of Document 1 was a manager of a Dutch-government-owned 
sugar factory in Indonesia. As a manager, it would have been his duty to 
report to his superiors about the damage that the Dutch Cultivation System 
had inflicted on the availability of Indonesian labor for his factory. (POV, 
purpose) 
The Cultivation System was an attempt by the Dutch colonial authorities in 
the East Indies to force the native population to produce cash crops for the 
Dutch. This reflected a general push to make colonies more profitable for 
Europe by extracting raw materials or commodities for export. (situation) 
•  As Great Britain was becoming an increasingly industrialized country during 
this period, the purpose of the EIC providing this data to Parliament may 
have been in part to show that it was playing its part in providing markets 
for British industrial goods, the most important one of which was cotton 
textiles. (purpose) 

• 

•  Because of the system of Company Rule in India, the EIC, rather than the 
British government, had effective control of large parts of the Indian 
subcontinent. That explains why it was the EIC’s responsibility to collect such 
trade information and report it to the British Parliament. (situation) 
The publication of this perspective on the economic impact of India’s trade 
with Great Britain in an Indian (Bengali) newspaper was likely meant in part 
to challenge the Indian audience’s notions of rigid caste distinctions. By 
emphasizing that the ‘reluctance to give up hereditary trades’ has become 
an economic liability, the author is urging Indians to loosen the rigid 
restrictions in their society in order to make India more adaptable to 
economic change. (audience, purpose) 
The article suggests that Chatterjee shared the position of many educated 
Indian intellectuals at the time that India could benefit socially and 
economically from British rule. He emphasizes the economic benefits of 
trade with Britain and the opportunities trade may bring for modernizing 
Indian society. (POV, situation)

Khumalo, Contract with 
an English company over 
mining rights in Ndebele 
territory, 1888 

The ruler of the Ndebele enters into a 
contract with three British business 
associates of Cecil Rhodes’ mining 
company, awarding them exclusive mining 
rights in his territories, in exchange for a 
monthly payment, English rifles, and a 
promise to deliver a steamboat with guns

6. Ndansi Kumalo, 
account of living 
conditions of the 
Ndebele in the 1890s, 
given to a British 
anticolonial activist, 
published in 1936 

•  Describes the hardships on the native 
population produced by the Belgian 
authorities’ cruel system of extracting 
rubber by imposing rubber production 
quotas on Congolese villages. The villagers 
found it harder and harder to meet the 
quota, needing to go further and further 
into the jungle to find rubber trees. As 
more members of village society, including 
women, had to work to make the rubber 
quota, cultivation of food crops was 
abandoned, and starvation set in. The 
authorities did not reduce the quota and 
only provided token payments for the 
rubber. 

•  Outlines the shifts in Ndebele economic 

activities after the end of the unsuccessful 
Ndebele revolt in 1897; the Ndebele had 
lost their cattle (traditional source of 
wealth) during the revolt and were forced 
into paid work for the White settlers, in 
mines and in agriculture. In addition to 
that, the Ndebele were subjected to heavy 
taxes by the British colonial government, 
including a rent tax for allegedly living on 
White settlers’ land. 

• 

The Ndebele ruler, whose territory was probably under a lot of pressure 
from White settlers as well as from neighboring African groups, likely 
thought that he had no choice but to trade away the right to mine raw 
materials in his country to the English in exchange for guns and a steamboat 
with which he could defend himself. (POV, situation) 

• 

•  By emphasizing that “various [other] persons and companies” have sought 
the rights to mine in his territories, King Lobengula may have wanted to 
convey to Cecil Rhodes’ company that his company must abide by its 
obligations under the contract. (purpose, audience) 
The Belgian authorities’ system of rubber extraction from the Congo reflects 
both the prevalent racial views in late-nineteenth-century Europe that saw 
Africans as racially inferior, and thus they were subjected to inhumane 
working conditions. Europeans also recognized the economic importance of 
strategic natural resources such as rubber to Europe’s industrializing 
economies. (situation) 

•  As an eyewitness account of a refugee from the atrocities it describes, 
Moyo’s account is likely credible in its description of the devastating 
economic and social toll of the Belgian rubber quota systems on Congolese 
villages. (POV) 

•  As an oral history narrative recorded decades after the events it describes, 
Ndansi Kumalo’s account represents a long-term assessment of the social 
and economic effects of the Ndebele revolt on the Ndebele people. As such 
it focuses on big changes, such as, the transition from subsistence cattle 
raising to wage work, especially in mining, and the transition to being 
integrated into the White-settler dominated economy of South Africa 
through the paying of taxes and using money. (audience, POV) 
The context of the economic and social changes described in the document 
is the growing rate of White settlement in interior parts of southern Africa 
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, encroaching on the 
lands of native peoples such as the Ndebele. The discovery of gold, 
diamonds, and other resources in various parts of the region exacerbated 
this process. (situation)

7. Anonymous 
Tanzanian participant in 
Maji Maji uprising, 
account of conditions on 
German cotton 
plantations during the 
1900s, published in 
1967 

•  Describes the labor obligations imposed on 
Africans by the German colonizers’ creation 
of cotton plantations in the first decade of 
the twentieth century. African villagers 
were required to work on the cotton 
plantations on allotted days of the week. 
Work conditions on the plantations were 
brutal, and Africans were also subjected to 
paying taxes in addition to their forced 
labor obligations. This led to Africans 
hating German rule. 

• 

The purpose of the account is to document the cruelty of the Germans and 
the economic hardships placed on Africans working on the cotton 
plantations. Because the account was given to African historians after 
Tanzania became independent, they would likely have wanted to emphasize 
the negative aspects of European imperialism. (purpose, audience) 
•  As a relative latecomer to European imperialism in Africa, Germany was 
eager to show that it could bring “progress” to its African colonies, which 
often meant starting economic activities in the colonies that would be 
profitable to the German colonialists. The cotton plantations in Tanzania 
(Tanganyika) were an example of such enterprises, where resource 
extraction was accomplished at the cost of harsh economic exploitation of 
the African workers. (situation)

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based 
on evidence provided by a select set of historical documents. The Document-Based Question (DBQ) 
asked students to evaluate the extent to which European imperialism had an impact on the economies 
of Africa and/or Asia. Responses were expected to address the time frame of the 19th through the early 
20th centuries and to demonstrate the historical thinking skill of causation. The question addressed 
Topics 6.2 and 6.5 and Key Concepts 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 of the AP World History Course Framework. 

Sample: 1A 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 3 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 7 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim at the top of the second page, specifying that 
imperialism shaped the region “via exploitation-based economies and economies reliant on Europe.” 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 

The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the first paragraph for a wide-ranging 
discussion of imperial, colonial, and economic developments relevant to Asia, Africa, and Europe. 
Multiple specific examples (such as the Industrial Revolution, the American wars of independence, 
the reference to a “second wave of imperialism,” etc.) show a clear grasp of changes over time in the 
global balance of power, in European imperial expansion, and in economic activity. Multiple 
statements relate this context directly to the argument, for instance, the statement that “many 
countries . . . replaced their joint-stock companies with stricter government-based colonial control,” 
so that the context and thesis are effectively developed and mutually intertwined throughout the 
entire first paragraph. 

C. Evidence (0–3 points): 3 

Evidence from the Documents 
The response earned 2 points for evidence by using all seven documents to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. The documentary evidence is organized and sequenced in such a manner 
that each piece of evidence is corroborated by other source material.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
The response earned 1 point for evidence beyond the documents for the detailed discussion of the 
White Man’s Burden concept at the end of page 3. There are additional scorable examples in the 
introduction, such as the mentions of the Indian Revolt, British-Mughal trade, or the transition from 
East India Company control to government control. The elaboration on Cecil Rhodes at the closing of 
the response is another instance. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 2 

Document Sourcing 
The response earned 1 point for sourcing the documents. The response notes plausibly that the 
factory manager’s descriptions in Document 1 “may be inflated” for reasons of personal gain, that 
the witness’s firsthand experience of suffering described in Document 5 helps clarify his purpose, 
and that the long delay between the events described in Document 6 and the recording of the memoir 
brings the veracity of the document into question. The “false and tricky treaties with local chiefs” in 
the Congo mentioned at the end of the second page, or the practice of Indian elites receiving 
education in Britain serve effectively as historical-situation sourcing analysis for Documents 5 and 3, 
respectively; alternatively, these details could qualify as evidence beyond the documents if more had 
been necessary to earn the point. The White Man’s Burden and “civilization” discussions similarly 
function to situate Document 6. Finally, the response zeroes in on the anonymous nature of the 
speaker in Document 7 to analyze point of view. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response earned 1 point for complexity. Already in the introductory paragraph, the response 
demonstrates a complex understanding of the causes and consequences of European imperialism, as 
well as the interconnections between imperialism and economic activity. Throughout the response, 
evidence from the documents as well as additional evidence is marshaled and deployed in a 
sophisticated fashion that acknowledges contradictions and effectively qualifies and corroborates 
the argument. The sourcing analysis, in particular, shows an advanced understanding of the nature 
of historical evidence, weighing credibility and modifying the argument accordingly.

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim in the first paragraph, by asserting that “exploiting the 
labor of indigenous peoples to gather resources” and “expand[ing] markets to yield the most profit” 
led to a decline in the “economies of the colonized (Asia and Africa).”

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 

The response earned 1 point for contextualization through the introductory paragraph’s statement 
connecting the Industrial Revolution and imperialism. 

C. Evidence (0–3 points): 3 

Evidence from the Documents 
The response earned 2 points for evidence by supporting the argument with information from each 
of the seven documents. 

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
In addition, the response earned 1 point for evidence beyond the documents for using (on page 3) the 
British opium trade in China as an example of economic damage done to an Asian society by 
European imperialism. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 0 

Document Sourcing 
The response did not earn the point for sourcing the documents because it does not attempt sourcing 
analysis of any documents. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or 
Asia. 

Sample: 1C 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 1 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 2 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim by establishing trade and labor forces as economic 
categories of analysis for an argument about the impact of European imperialism in Asia and Africa. 
The concluding paragraph includes a slightly different comparative claim (about European 
imperialism having a greater economic impact in Africa than in Asia), which could have earned the 
thesis point as well.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 

The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The second sentence of the first paragraph 
contains an attempt to situate imperialism historically, but it is too vague and overgeneralized to. 

C. Evidence (0–3 points): 1 

Evidence from the Documents 
The response earned 1 point for evidence by using Documents 3, 4, 5, and 6 to address the topic. 
These four documents are also used as evidence in support of various claims and arguments. 
However, because the response does not address Documents 1, 2, and 7, it did not meet the 
requirements to earn the second evidence point. 

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
The response did not earn the point for evidence beyond the documents because it provides no 
additional pieces of specific historical evidence relevant to the prompt. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 0 

Document Sourcing 
The response did not earn the point for sourcing the documents. The response did successfully 
analyze the authors’ purpose in Documents 5 (“to expose the horrible labor & to advocate for better 
working conditions”) and 6 (“as a voice to represent the Ndebele, the purpose of his memoir was to 
show the economical decline that his people were facing”), but the attempt at sourcing analysis for 
Document 4 (at the bottom of page 3) inaccurately represents the nature of the contract. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or 
Asia.
