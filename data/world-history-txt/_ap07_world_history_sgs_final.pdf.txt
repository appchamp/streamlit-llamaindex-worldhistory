2007 SCORING GUIDELINES 

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must include both Han and Roman attitudes toward technology with 

correct qualification of each empire. 

•  The thesis does NOT have to include a comparison of Han and Roman attitudes. 
•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay. 
•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs, or merely restates the prompt 

is unacceptable. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.)  
•  Students must address all eight documents in the essay. 
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least seven  

documents. 

•  Listing the documents separately or as a group does not adequately demonstrate 

an understanding of basic meaning. 

•  Merely quoting from the document does not demonstrate basic understanding. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from seven or eight documents and address the question. 
For 1 point: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from six documents and address the question.  

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 

1 Point 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular  

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description of that individual by considering  
and explaining the tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, 
and/or how the intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 
o  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two or three ways, 

depending on the question. 
•  Students must explicitly address the question by grouping the documents in  
at least two ways. Some examples include type(s) of technology, pro and con  
technology, role(s) of government with respect to technology, or by class,  
philosophers, government officials. 

•  Noting the Han documents (Documents 1–4) and/or the Roman documents  
(Documents 5–8) will NOT count as groupings, BUT noting Han or Roman  
officials or Han or Roman upper classes as groups is acceptable.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

6.   Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional    

document or source. 
•  Students must identify an appropriate additional type of document or source  
and explain how the document or source will contribute to an analysis of Han  
and Roman attitudes toward technology. 
             Some potential additional types of documents: 

1 Point 

o  Documents by women—to explore whether there are similarities or differences  

in Han/Roman attitudes according to gender. 

o  Documents by workers—to explore the attitudes of those classes that might be  
most affected by various technologies or those classes that would physically  
implement a new technology. 

o  Documents with data about the effects of various technologies (road building,  

irrigation) to help explain positive/negative attitudes. 

o  Documents regarding the economic effects of technologies to help explain  

positive/negative attitudes.
