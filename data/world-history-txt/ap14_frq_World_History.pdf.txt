Document 1 

Source: Mao Zedong, rising leader of the Chinese Communist Party, written report on 
the peasant movement in central China, 1927. 

The present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event. In a very short time, in 
China’s central, southern, and northern provinces, several hundred million peasants will 
rise like a mighty storm, like a hurricane, a force so swift and violent that no power, 
however great, will be able to hold it back. They will smash all the chains that bind them 
and rush forward along the road to liberation. They will sweep all the imperialists, 
warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil landowners into their graves.  

Document 2 

Source: Conversation between a teenaged peasant and his grandfather, from an area 
controlled by Chinese Communists, recounted by Edgar Snow, United States journalist,
1936. 

Grandfather, you call villagers joining the Poor People’s league, voting for Communists, 
having their sons join Communist armies or daughters enroll in schools crimes? These 
are patriotic acts! Did we have a free school before? Did we ever get news of the world 
before the Communists brought us radios? Who told us what the world was like? You 
say the cooperative has no cloth, but did we even have a cooperative before? How about 
your farm? Wasn’t there a big mortgage on it to landlord Wang? My sister starved to 
death three years ago, but haven’t we had plenty to eat since the Communists came? 
You say it’s bitter, but it isn’t bitter for us Young Communist Vanguards when we learn 
to use a rifle and fight traitors and Japan! 

Document 3 

Source: Japanese Political Affairs Bureau for Occupied China, administrative office of the 
Japanese Army, report, 1941. 

The Chinese Communist Red Army champions army-civilian integration and is 
continuously organizing local guerrilla units. As a consequence, it is extraordinarily 
difficult to separate the Communist bandits from the peasants in our efforts to destroy  
the Communists.

Document 4 

Source: Chinese Communist report on Japanese military actions in North China villages, 
1942. 

In Japanese attacks on our villages, they killed 97 civilians, wounded 382, kidnapped 3, 
and raped 216 women. Japanese soldiers stole farm animals (734 oxen, 694 mules,  
6 donkeys, 45 horses, 734 hogs, 6 goats, 106 ducks, 13,817 chickens); thousands of 
chairs and tables, kitchen pots and rice bowls, and stone grinders; thousands of peasants’ 
quilts and piles of clothing; over 6,000 bushels of grain; tons of straw; and 430,000 
yuan.* 

*yuan: Chinese currency 

Document 5 

Source: Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, instructions to local party 
officials, 1942. 

Recognize that peasants constitute the basic strength of the Anti-Japanese War. 
Accordingly it is the policy of the party to assist the peasant, reduce feudal exploitation 
by the landlords, support civil liberties, political rights, and economic rights of the 
peasants in order to improve their living conditions and enhance their enthusiasm for  
the Anti-Japanese War. 

Document 6 

Source: William Hinton, United States–born member of a Chinese Communist land 
reform task force in northern China, 1948. 

The arming of the people for resistance against Japan had placed the peasants in a 
position to challenge the landlords and money lenders in the countryside, and not even 
the tremendous prestige of the Chinese Communist Party or the critical situation of the 
country and the world could prevent this challenge from breaking out in one form or 
another. This increasingly explosive force transferred land from the landowners to the 
peasants. Now peasants demanded not only the correction of abuses but also repayment 
of overcharges and restoration of lands and property seized in default of debts. When 
grievances were totaled up, the charges almost always amounted to more than most 
landowning families could pay, and everything they owned was transferred from the 
landlords to the peasants for distribution.

Document 7 

Source: Marriage Law of the People’s Republic of China, 1950. 

The feudal marriage system based on arbitrary and compulsory arrangements and the 
supremacy of man over woman, and in disregard of the interest of the children, is 
abolished. 

The new democratic marriage system, which is based on the free choice of partners, on 
monogamy, on equal rights for both sexes, and on the protection of the lawful interests 
of women and children, is put into effect. 

Document 8 

Source: Agrarian Reform Law of the People’s Republic of China, 1950. 

Article 1.  The landownership system of feudal exploitation by the landlord class shall 
be abolished and the system of peasant landownership shall be introduced in order to set 
free the rural productive forces, develop agricultural production, and thus pave the way 
for new China’s industrialization. 

Article 2.  The land, draft animals, farm implements, and surplus grain of the landlords 
and their surplus houses in the countryside shall be confiscated.
