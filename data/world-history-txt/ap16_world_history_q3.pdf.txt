2016 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

This question asked students to analyze similarities and differences in the causes of two (out of a choice of 
three) Atlantic World eighteenth-century revolutions. This content is part of Key Concept 5.3. of the AP 
World History Curriculum Framework (Nationalism, Revolution, and Reform). By focusing on the historical 
thinking skill of Causation, the question required students to take an analytical approach and compare the 
factors that led to the outbreak of the chosen revolutions, rather than merely describe and juxtapose events 
and/or individuals that were part of the course of the chosen revolutions. By including the American 
Revolution as one of the three options, the question gave most students the chance to discuss as part of 
their answers content with which many felt relatively comfortable. One result of this was that the other 
two options in the comparison (the Haitian and/or French Revolution) became, in effect the “high bar” and 
provided opportunities for additional differentiation among student responses.  

Sample: 3A 
Score: 9 

The thesis is in the first paragraph and addresses both a similarity and a difference between the causes of 
the French and American Revolutions, which earned 1 point for thesis. The essay proceeds to discuss both 
the similarity (influence of Enlightenment ideas) and the difference (the American Revolution being a colonial 
revolution to achieve independence from the mother country and the French Revolution being a “home 
revolution” to create a more representative government) identified in the thesis in two lengthy body 
paragraphs. This earned 2 points for addressing all parts of the question. The essay substantiates the thesis 
with well over 20 pieces of appropriate historical evidence, some related to the American Revolution and 
other evidence related to the French Revolution. This earned the essay 2 points for using evidence. There is 
an additional direct comparison (other than the one used to earn credit for Core Point 2) toward the middle of 
page 1, where an additional similarity in the causes of both revolutions —political “under-representation” — 
is identified and discussed. This earned the essay 1 point for direct comparison. There is persuasive analysis 
of the reasons for both the similarities and differences identified in the comparison between the two 
revolutions, which earned the essay 1 point for analysis. Specifically, the analysis point was earned by the 
essay addressing the concept of the social contract and its revolutionary implications (as an explanation of 
the similarity of the two revolutions being influenced by Enlightenment ideas on page 1) and by the 
discussion of the different role of social class (as an explanation of the difference in the type of grievances 
that led to the two revolutions on page 3). In addition to earning all 7 points in the Basic Core, the essay 
earned the maximum of 2 points in the Expanded Core for the plentiful evidence used in support of the 
thesis, the high level of analysis, and the overall depth of argumentation and organization.

The attempted thesis in the first paragraph did not earn the thesis point. It discusses a valid difference 
between the causes of the American and French Revolutions, “the Americans were seeking independence 
from their mother country (Britain) while France was seeking to overthrow its own government.” However, 
the similarities it addresses are either related to outcomes rather than causes (both revolutions “established 
democracy and a constitution”) or are too generic to be creditable, (for example, the statement that both 
revolutions were “uprisings of the people to overthrow their monarchical governments.”) Because the essay 
did not earn the thesis point, the valid statement of difference in the introductory paragraph was credited 
toward the Core Points for addressing all parts of the question. The second paragraph on page 1 identifies a 
valid similarity between the causes of the two revolutions (popular anger at existing governments for

Question 3 (continued)  

imposing high taxes), which, together with the discussion of a difference in the introductory paragraph, 
earned the essay 2 points for addressing all parts of the question. The essay uses seven pieces of relevant 
evidence in support of its argument: prerevolutionary monarchical governments; the revolutions leading to 
the establishment of constitutions; prerevolutionary governments imposing heavy taxes; the desire to 
establish a representative government (“the right to play a role in the government”); nationalism as a factor in 
the genesis of the revolutions; the idea of the social contract; and the role of the American Revolution as an 
inspiration for the French Revolution. This was sufficient to earn the essay 2 points for evidence support. The 
essay does not include a direct comparison between the two revolutions other than the discussion of a 
similarity and a difference used to earn the Core Points for addressing all parts of the question; therefore the 
essay did not earn the point for direct comparison. The essay did not earn the point for analysis as neither the 
discussion of a similarity (paragraph 2 on page 1) nor the discussion of a difference (paragraph 3 on pages  
1–2) contains analysis of causes. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

The essay does not have a thesis, and it did not earn the thesis point. It makes several vaguely comparative 
statements about the French and the American revolutions; however, the only statement that was creditable 
(as a valid similarity in the causes of the two revolutions) is the claim that both revolutions “began based off 
[E]nlightenment ideas.” That statement earned the essay 1 point for addressing all parts of the question. The 
statement that purports to identify a difference — “America didn’t end in a [r]eign like the French”— does 
not relate to causes and could not be credited for the second Core Point for addressing all parts of the 
question. The essay did not earn any points for using evidence because there are, at most, three pieces of 
relevant evidence mentioned: “economic instability due to the debt,” the Enlightenment, and the Reign of 
Terror in the French Revolution. No points were awarded for a direct comparison or for analysis, as the essay 
contains no attempts to earn these points.
