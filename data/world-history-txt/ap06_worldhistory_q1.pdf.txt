Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence) 
(Historical skills and knowledge required to show competence.) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis cannot be split and must be located in either the introductory  

paragraph or the conclusion.  
o 
o 

It may be a number of contiguous sentences. 
It cannot simply repeat the question.  

•  The thesis must address the social and economic effects of the global flow  

of silver as indicated in the documents. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

(May misinterpret one document.)  
•  There are eight documents. Students must address all documents in the essay  

and demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least seven documents.  

Listing the documents separately or listing the documents as part of a group does  
sufficiently demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one  

document. 
For 2 points: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from seven or eight documents and be connected  

to the thesis. 

For 1 point: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from six documents and must be connected  

to the thesis. 

1 Point 

2 Points 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 

1 Point 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 
o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this  
particular opinion OR what particular feature informs the author’s  
point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description of that individual by  

considering and explaining the tone, the characteristics of the author,  
the intended audience and/or how the intended outcome may have  
influenced the author’s opinion. 

Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating the  
information from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two or three ways,  

depending on the question. 
•  Students must explicitly group the documents in at least two ways. 

6.   Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate  
   additional document or source. 

•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document or source and  

explain how the document or source will contribute to an analysis of the effects 
of the silver trade.

2006 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Overview 

The document-based question asked students to use eight documents to analyze the social and economic 
effects of the silver trade while demonstrating specific analytical skills. The documents contained ample 
evidence to support a number of different thesis statements ranging from class divisions to the effects of 
inflation to globalizing international trade. Each of the documents offered a clear opportunity for point-of-
view analysis. Moreover, the language of many documents prompted such analysis based on tone. None of 
the documents could be categorized as purely social or purely economic, which resulted in a variety of 
grouping opportunities. The need for additional documents was clear, given the absence of documentary 
evidence from Japan, Portugal, Chinese peasant farmers, or South American miners. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 9 

The thesis in the first paragraph, spread across two sentences, addresses social and economic effects  
(1 point). All of the documents are addressed in the essay as is the meaning of each document (1 point). 
Evidence from each of the documents supports the thesis (2 points). Note that the reference to the 
encomienda system does not affect the use of evidence in the essay. The analysis of point of view is 
evident for Documents 4 and 6 (1 point). The documents are analyzed in three groups: Chinese, Spanish, 
and middlemen (1 point). Both suggestions for additional documents (Ming peasants and a Japanese 
perspective on silver mining) are appropriate and adequately explained (1 point). Expanded core points 
were earned for the use of historical context, the analytical nature of the thesis, and additional documents 
(2 points). 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6 

The thesis, linking silver to trade connections as well as to increasing labor and social unrest, comprises 
the last two sentences of the first paragraph (1 point). All of the documents are addressed in the essay as is 
the meaning of each document (1 point). Evidence from each of the documents supports the thesis  
(2 points). The documents are analyzed in three groups: effects on China, the European advantage, and 
European observers (1 point). The additional document is well explained at the end of the essay (1 point). 
The essay attempts to discuss point of view, but the analysis does not meet the minimum standard. 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 4 

The essay lacks an acceptable thesis. All of the documents are addressed in the essay as is the meaning of 
each document (1 point). Evidence from each of the documents supports the thesis (2 points). There are 
two evident groups in the essay: China and Europe (1 point), but the analysis of point of view is absent. 
The suggestion for an additional document at the end of the essay did not earn a point because it does not 
explain how the perspective of a woman or a peasant would contribute to the analysis of social and 
economic effects.
