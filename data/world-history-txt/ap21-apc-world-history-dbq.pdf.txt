Question 1: Document-Based Question, Economic Factors in the Mexican Revolution 

7 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature 

of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the 
argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Evaluate the extent to which economic factors led to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920).

1 point 
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a 
line of reasoning. 

Scoring Criteria 

Responses that do not earn this point: 
•  Are not historically defensible. 
•  Only restate or rephrase the prompt. 
•  Do not respond to the prompt. 
•  Do not establish a line of reasoning. 
•  Are overgeneralized. 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
•  Provide a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a position on the 
extent to which economic factors led to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution 
(1910–1920). The thesis or claim must either provide some indication of the reason 
for making that claim OR establish categories of the argument. 

Examples that do not earn this point: 
Provide a historically defensible claim, but do not establish a line of 
reasoning 
• 

“Economic factors were critical in leading to the outbreak of the 
Mexican Revolution.” 

Establish a line of reasoning, but do not provide a historically 
defensible claim 
• 

“Economic exploitation in Mexico led to the revolution because most 
of the Mexican people were enslaved on plantations.” 

Do not focus on the topic of the prompt 
•  “The Mexican Revolution is important to understand because it is 

the southern neighbor of the United States.” 

Examples that earn this point: 
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt 
• 

“Mexico’s inability to resist the political dominance of the United States and 
European powers was the most significant factor in leading to the revolution 
because foreign dominance prevented the Mexican government from enacting 
economic reforms.” 

• 

“Ethnic tensions were just as important in leading to the Mexican Revolution as 
economic factors because much of the economic exploitation that was occurring in 
Mexico affected poor indigenous communities.” 

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic 
categories 
• 

“Although noneconomic factors such as government corruption and ethnic tensions 
contributed to the Mexican Revolution, economic factors such as labor exploitation 
and economic inequality were the most important factors in sparking the 
revolution.” 

Establish a line of reasoning  
• 

“The government’s policies led to the Mexican Revolution because the government 
refused to help workers.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim) 

Additional Notes: 
•  The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the 

first or last paragraphs). 

•  The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 
• 

(Document 1): “The finance minister tells strikers that 
unemployment is the result of supply and demand and is out of the 
government’s hands, a position which probably increased people’s 
discontent with the government because they were unwilling to 
help.” (Connects the contents of the document to an argument 
about the extent to which economic factors contributed to the 
outbreak of the Mexican Revolution) 
(Document 2): “The newspaper cartoon shows that the government 
was willing to use violence to put down popular protests against a 
rigged election system. Such oppressive government policies may 
have contributed to increased support for the eventual revolution.” 
(Connects the content of the document to an argument about the 
extent to which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of 
the Mexican Revolution)

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
•  Must explain how or why—rather than simply identifying—the document’s point of view, purpose, historical 
situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the three documents 
sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 
• 

(Document 3): “As a diplomatic representative of the Diaz government, Godoy is focused only on the positive 
aspects of United States investment in Mexico and lavishes praise on Diaz.” (Identifies the point of view of the 
source and how this might be relevant to the extent to which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of 
the Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose:  
• 

(Document 7): “The corrido is meant to memorialize a hero of the revolution and to motivate the people to carry 
on his struggle, and to ‘punish the rich’ and make ‘Indians owners of their lands,’ both of which were major 
economic goals of the revolutionaries.” (Connects the purpose of the song to an argument about the extent to 
which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: 
• 

(Document 6): “Ricardo Magón uses the history of Native Americans, especially the taking of their land and their 
oppression by white colonizers to argue for a revolution that would take back the land and give it to the workers, 
pointing out the fundamental corruption that allowed Spanish elites to acquire the land that the native 
Americans now work.” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical situation of the document and connects that 
information to an argument about the extent to which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of the 
Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience:

conscious of their influence in channeling United States investment to Mexico.” (Provides information about the 
audience of the government official that is relevant to an argument about the extent to which economic factors 
contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution)

Complexity 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point:  
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple 

causes, or explaining both causes and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. 
•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. 
•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Analyzing multiple variables, such as considering diverse or alternate perspectives or evidence, such as how, for 
instance, a response arguing that economic exploitation in Mexico often coincided with the oppression of ethnic 
minorities could use Documents 6 and 7 to show how some revolutionaries specifically appealed to Native 
histories of dispossession and complement this analysis with the description of the enslavement of Yaqui 
Indians in Document 4 in service of plantations producing materials for European and U.S. industry. (Explains 
nuance) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining similarities and 

differences between the motivating factors of the Mexican Revolution and other revolutions in the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries. For instance, a response could draw explicit and insightful comparisons by bringing in 
outside information on the situation in Russia prior to the Bolshevik Revolution and then using the documents 
describing the situation of the peasants and workers in Mexico to show how economic problems fueled 
revolutionary movements in both countries. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as explaining how different documents corroborate an argument in 
spite of the differing perspectives of the authors. For instance, a response could use the praise of Diaz in 
Document 3, which celebrates the business relationship between the U.S. and Mexico and how Mexico enacted 
laws to benefit U.S. businesses, to corroborate the documents that show the problems and challenges faced by 
Mexican workers and peasants that result from the economic system that developed in Mexico. (Corroborates, 
qualifies, or modifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Explains the relevance of point of view (POV), purpose, situation, and/or audience by elaborating 
on examples such as: 
•  By telling striking workers the government is not going to intervene on their behalf, he makes it 
clear the government favors corporate interests and will not help the strikers. (audience) 
Shows the economic philosophy of the Mexican government at the time being in favor of 
unfettered free markets and a noninterventionist, laissez-faire approach to industrial disputes 
which ultimately favored employers and corporate interests. (historical situation) 

• 

The finance minister tells the 
strikers that the problems of the 
workers are not solvable by the 
government, as Mexican law 
prevents interference with 
business practices regarding 
wages, working conditions, etc. 

The cartoon shows mounted 
soldiers violently attacking street 
protesters demonstrating against 
a disputed presidential election. 

• 

• 

The artist shows the protesters sympathetically, meaning the cartoon was intended to criticize 
the government’s actions against them. (purpose) 
Published in a mass-produced and likely cheap news print called “Street Gazette,” the cartoon is 
clearly addressing a very broad section of Mexico’s public. Even those who were illiterate would 
have been able to see the violence and brutality of the government’s suppression of protest in 
the cartoon. (POV/audience) 

•  As a diplomatic representative of the Diaz government, Godoy is focused only on the positive 

aspects of United States investment in Mexico and lavishes praise on Diaz. (POV) 

•  Godoy wants to ensure the continued support of the United States for the Díaz government, so 
he presents a rosy picture of economic progress and social harmony under Díaz’s rule. (purpose) 

Praises the good business 
relations between the U.S. and 
Mexico and the economic 
progress foreign investment has 
allowed in Mexico. Glorifies 
President Díaz as the “right man 
in the right place, at the right 
time” for Mexico. 

•  Discusses how the production of 

henequen on plantations 
involves the use of forced labor 
from indigenous Mexicans and 
Asians and how the workers are 
effectively enslaved by debt 
servitude. 

•  By using the tradition of “muckraking” journalism during the United States Progressive Era, the 
author is trying to get people in the United States to be outraged by the use of what is in effect 
slavery in Mexico. (POV/purpose) 
Since slavery had been abolished in the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere at 
the time the book was published, this author’s use of the term “slavery” to describe the system of 
labor would be deliberately calculated to inflame public opinion. (historical situation)

• 

The purpose of the report was to inform the Senate on the levels of United States business 
investment in Mexico. The Senate may have sought that information because of the perceived 
risk to United States investments in Mexico given the growing political instability there. 
(POV/purpose) 
The table shows the heavy concentration of foreign investment in Mexico in those industries that 
relied on exploitation of Mexican natural resources (for example, mines, oil industry, rubber 
industry) or were most likely to be profitable (railways). This investment pattern is the hallmark of 
neocolonialism / economic imperialism. (historical situation)

return. Highlights Zapata’s role 
as a champion of the cause of 
the indigenous Mexicans against

• 

•  As an indigenous person himself, the author uses an idealized vision of the traditional indigenous 

communities using land and other resources in common to achieve social harmony, and 
advocates for changing the current economic and political situation along those communal lines. 
(POV) 
Shows the possible influence of the spread of Marxist ideology in its attack on the idea of private 
property and advocating for a return to communalism. (historical situation) 

• 

•  Meant to inspire Zapata’s followers to keep fighting for the cause of the revolution even after

Question 1 — Document Based Question  

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
evidence within historical documents. This Document-Based Question (DBQ) asked students to evaluate the 
extent to which economic factors led to the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920. The question addressed Topic 
7.1: Shifting Power After 1900 of the AP World History Course Framework, and specifically Key Concept KC-
6.2.II.D. The question provided opportunities for students to demonstrate all four of the historical reasoning 
skills, with a central focus on the skill of Causation. Responses were also expected to demonstrate the 
disciplinary practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence (primary sources) and Argument Development. The six 
text-based documents and one image provided evidence of causes of the Mexican Revolution. They provided 
students with multiple perspectives on the origins of the event, allowing students to develop their own 
argument as to the extent of economic influence on the origins of the revolution. Responses were expected to 
evaluate the sources, to add relevant historical detail, and to utilize the pieces of evidence to support and 
qualify an argument. Students also were asked to contextualize their essays by providing a larger historical 
framework within which the Mexican Revolution was situated. Responses were asked to provide explanation 
or description of the primary source documents’ point of view, historical situation, intended audience, and/or 
purpose. Students could also demonstrate complexity by creating nuanced arguments, extended discussions of 
key developments, and/or consistently corroborating documents by analyzing their commonalities and 
differences. 

Sample: 1A 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 3 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 7 

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point for the last sentence of the first paragraph, which identifies two distinct factors 
(“the failure of the Mexican government under Porfirio Diaz to provide suitable working conditions” and “the 
role of the government in supporting the oppressive industries of factories and plantations for the pursuit of a 
profit”) as reasons for the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution. 

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point in the first two sentences of the first paragraph by connecting the process of 
industrialization and that the working class’s “faught for fair condition” to revolutions.  

C. Evidence (0−3 points): 3 

Evidence from the Documents  
The response earned 1 point for using six sources, omitting only Document 7. 

The response earned the second evidence point by making arguments about foreign influence (supported by 
Documents 5 and 3), unfavorable labor practices, (supported by Documents 4 and 6), and the government’s 
failure to address poor working conditions in Mexico (supported by Documents 6, 1, and 2).

Question 1 — Document Based Question (continued) 

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
The response earned the point by explaining and analyzing the encomienda system (at the top of the second 
page), making a direct link tracing the original land and labor injustices through the colonial period up to the 
modern day, and tying these specifically back to Document 6 which “uses this injustice to justify the right of 
Native Americans to take back their land and end the corrupt labor system” in the twentieth century.  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 2 

Document Sourcing 
The response earned the point for successfully sourcing three or more documents. The analysis of Document 3 
uses the celebratory purpose of the consul’s toast to explain that “it may overstate” its positive description of 
the situation in Mexico. The analysis of Document 4 identifies the sensationalist purpose and foreign point of 
view of the author as possibly damaging his credibility but carefully judges the source still to be useful to the 
argument about poor labor conditions in Mexico. The analysis of Document 6 points out the Native American 
ethnic identity of the author as potentially influencing his point of view and possibly leading him to exaggerate 
the plight of the Mexican peasantry. Finally, the analysis of Document 1 uses the fact that the author is a 
government official to explain the disconnect between this author and his audience on the matter of labor 
practices. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response earned the point for demonstrating complex understanding through interrelated use of evidence 
to corroborate multiple perspectives across course themes and weaving together documents in support of one 
another in a nuanced way. For instance, the investment data in the table (Document 5) is used to elaborate on 
the “increase in foreign capital” mentioned in the consul’s toast from (Document 3), which is in turn explicitly 
contrasted with the poor conditions of the farmworkers described in Document 4. Similarly, the position and 
perspective of laborers and land reformers evident in Documents 4 and 6 are juxtaposed with the government’s 
obdurate denial of workers’ rights and, indeed, crackdown as shown in Documents 1 and 2. Overall, the 
response carries a nuanced line of multiple-causation reasoning consistently through the analysis of both 
documentary and outside evidence. 

Sample: 1B 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 4 

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point at the end of the first paragraph, by identifying “harsh working conditions and 
corrupt leadership” as factors that led “the working class of Mexico” to revolt against the government 
"[r]egardless of the economic prosperity seen in official documentation.”  

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point in the first paragraph for discussing “an increase in ideals of freedom and self 
determination” in the period before the Mexican Revolution. The response further states that “[b]ecoming a 
world power became increasingly beneficial and in turn, pushed people in power to push their citizens to 
become overworked with little compensation.” Although these statements are vague, they are sufficient to have 
earned the contextualization point.

Question 1 — Document Based Question (continued) 

C. Evidence (0−3 points): 2 

Evidence from the Documents 
The response earned 1 point  for  using six documents. Document 5 is omitted.  

The response earned the second evidence point by successfully supporting claims or arguments with six 
documents. Documents 4, 6, and 7 are used in support of an argument that the Mexican government failed to 
help the lower classes, and Documents 1, 2, and 3 are used to support an argument that the government was 
corrupt and oppressive. 

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
The response did not earn the point as it does not discuss any relevant evidence beyond that provided in the 
documents. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 0 

Document Sourcing  
The response did not earn the point for sourcing the documents. The response only offers a single instance of

A. Thesis/Claim (0-1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point. The introductory paragraph includes a claim (“Economic factors like 
leaders lead to this revolt”), but it is not well articulated. The concluding paragraph specifies that the 
“economic factors” included “the non-careing president” and “the peoples land being taken away from and 
them turned into slaves,” but these references are also vague and/or inaccurate. 

B. Contextualization (0-1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point as there is no attempt at contextualization. 

C. Evidence (0-3 points): 1

Question 1 — Document Based Question (continued) 

The response did not earn the second evidence point. Only Documents 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 (one short of the 
number required to earn the point) are linked to an argument or claim tied to the prompt. Documents 1 and 2 
are used in support of claims that President Diaz “wouldn’t help the Mexican people with their workproblems” 
and that the people “didn’t like this man and they wanted him out of office.” Document 4 is used to support the 
claim that the Mexican government was “trapping” Mexican people into slavery. Document 5 is used to argue 
that “[a]ll this money wasn’t helping the Mexican people,” and Document 6  is used to support a claim that “the 
people wanted their land back and the government was doing nothing to help them.”  

Evidence Beyond the Documents 
The response did not earn the point as there is no attempt to provide evidence beyond the documents. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0-2 points): 0 

Document Sourcing 
The response did not earn the point for sourcing as it makes no sourcing attempts. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding as the quality of the argument 
did not meet the criteria for the complexity point.
