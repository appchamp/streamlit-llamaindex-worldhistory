Short Answer Question 4 (continued) 

•  One similarity was the emergence of new technological developments in agriculture, such as 

increasing mechanization in the period 1450–1900 and the development of new irrigation techniques 
during the Green Revolution. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

• 

Increases in food production during the Green Revolution were significantly higher than in the period 
1450–1900, as were the resulting population increases. 

•  The Green Revolution saw more sophistication as a result of greater scientific knowledge than in the 

period 1450–1900, as was evident in the introduction of new agricultural techniques such as the use of 
GMOs and the use of synthetic fertilizers. 

•  One difference between agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution was that 

agriculture in the earlier period did not significantly reduce the amount of cultivated land needed to 
sustain populations, whereas the Green Revolution did. 

•  One difference between agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution was that the 

most significant developments in agriculture in the period 1450–1900 occurred in fairly wealthy states 
in Western Europe, while the Green Revolution mostly affected developing countries in Asia and Latin 
America. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

One political response to the Green Revolution was states encouraging the use of green 
agricultural techniques to sustain economic development.  
A social response to the Green Revolution was that environmentalists increasingly protested 
against the use of pesticides such as DDT.  
A political response to the Green Revolution was the weakening of socialist movements in many 
developing states such as India, as governments increasingly sought to blunt calls for land reform 
by highlighting potential technological solutions and increasing crop yields. 
One social response to the Green Revolution was protests by small farmers in both developed and 
developing countries because the expense of introducing the new farming techniques associated 
with the Green Revolution increased significantly, leading over time to the concentration of more 
and more land in the hands of wealthy landowners and agribusinesses.

Short Answer Question 4 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify a similarity and explain a difference 
between agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution of the twentieth century. Additionally, 
student responses were expected to explain a political or social response to the Green Revolution during the 
twentieth century. The question addressed Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, 5.4, 6.1, and 6.3 in the AP World History 
Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of Comparison and Contextualization. 

Sample: 4A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for its discussion of how agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green 

Revolution both led to a “boost in population due to the surplus of food.” 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining that new technology and genetic engineering during the Green 

Revolution allowed people to cultivate previously unusable land, which was not possible in the period 1450–
1900. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining how protests about the use of pesticides constituted a social 

response to the Green Revolution. 

Sample: 4B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies that agricultural developments in the period 1450–1900 

and the Green Revolution led to a “large increase in food production.” 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that more advanced technology, genetically modified crops, 

and chemicals and pesticides were used during the Green Revolution to increase crop yields. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it explains environmental developments that occurred as 

results of the Green Revolution, but it did not explain a political or social response to the Green Revolution. 

Sample: 4C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because it does not identify a historically accurate example of a 
similarity between agricultural developments in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that the Green Revolution used genetically modified seeds 

“to make more and bigger appearing produce to sustain the population.” 

c) The response did not earn the point because it explains a demographic development that resulted from the 

Green Revolution rather than a social or political response.
