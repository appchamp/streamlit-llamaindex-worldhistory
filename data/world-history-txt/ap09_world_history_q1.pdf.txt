Question 1—Document-Based Question 

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  
•  The thesis must address at least two specific African responses to imperialism in  

a plausible fashion using evidence from the documents. 

•  Thesis statements such as “there were more reactions than actions” are not  

acceptable. 

•  Thesis statements that there were “positive and negative African reactions to”  

or “differing African views concerning” imperialism are not acceptable. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or in the specified conclusion  

of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple contiguous sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count as a point for meaning, evidence, or grouping. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of the documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 

•  Students must address all nine
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least eight

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of documents by  
grouping them with others that show a similar African reaction to imperialism. 
•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of the documents by accurately  

discussing European actions. 

•  Restating or quoting the content of the documents separately does not demonstrate  

an adequate understanding of meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document. 

2 Points  

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of an African response to imperialism must be  

explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of an African response to imperialism must be explicitly  

drawn from a minimum of seven

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 
•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two

 documents. 

1 Point 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular  
opinion or what particular feature informs the person’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description by considering and explaining the  
tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the  
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

o    Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but  
  must move beyond a mere statement of “bias” by providing some plausible analysis. 
o    Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information  

verbatim from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two ways.  
•  Students must explicitly and correctly group the documents in two ways
•  A minimum of two documents (used appropriately) constitutes a group or subgroup. 
•  Groupings must coherently address African responses to imperialism. Examples of such  

. 

1 Point 

groupings include: 
o  Violent resistance (Documents 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) 
o  Nonviolent/call for resistance (Documents 2, 6, 7, 8) 
o  Diplomacy/work with Europeans (Documents 1, 2, 3)  
o  Accommodation to European demands (Documents 1, 4, 6, 7) 
o  Resort to tradition or past ways (Documents 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) 

•  Documents grouped by “action and reaction,” location, or type of document are appropriate  

only if the student establishes a coherent and common African response for all  
documents within the group. 

6.  Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional  

 document or source.   

•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document or source and explain  

how it will contribute to the analysis of African responses to imperialism.

2009 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Overview 

The intent of the document-based question (DBQ) was to analyze African responses to European 
imperialism during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Unlike the pattern of most recent 
DBQs, these documents could not be simply “jigsawed” into categories of response. Many of the nine 
documents (most notably 3, 4, 6, and 7) had internal evidence that demonstrated multiple African 
responses. Given the richness and diversity of the sources, students could use individual documents in a 
variety of ways to represent different African responses to European imperialism. The multiple responses 
to be drawn from the documents included: 

“Nonviolent” calls for resistance (Documents 2, 6, 7, and 8) 

•  Violent resistance (Documents 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9) 
• 
•  Diplomacy (Documents 1, 2, and 3) 
•  Accommodation/submission to European demands (Documents 1, 4, 6, and 7) 
•  Resort to tradition (Documents 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) 

Attribution for the individual documents was clear and provided ample opportunities for discussion of 
point of view. In addition, missing points of view provided opportunity for analysis of potential additional 
documents and sources. The background information was clear and informative; students did not confuse 
it with the documents. 

Readers who scored this question were enthusiastic in their general agreement that this was an excellent 
DBQ. Students were given the opportunity to construct arguments in myriad ways with evidence of 
responses found internally within the same document(s). It was efficiently and accurately scored. 

Sample: 1A 
Score:  8 

The thesis is in the introduction and provides two groupings: “giving in peacefully,” which eventually led 
“to fighting back” (1 point). The student demonstrates understanding of all documents (1 point), and all but 
one document is used as evidence (2 points). Document 3 is the only document not used as evidence; its 
meaning is restated. The student analyzes the point of view in Documents 1, 5, and 9 (1 point). The 
documents are placed in two main groupings: accommodation (Documents 1, 2, 4, and 7) and resistance 
(Documents 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) (1 point). As can be seen, the student utilizes two documents (4 and 7) in 
both groups, providing evidence of multiple responses from within documents. The student requests an 
additional document that would help assess motivations of chiefs for signing the Niger River Company’s 
contract (1 point). The student received 1 expanded core point for good analysis of documents, more than 
two point-of-view analyses, and using documents in multiple groupings.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

Sample: 1B 
Score:  4 

The thesis identifies only one African response, violent rebellions, so the essay did not receive the thesis 
point. The student demonstrates understanding of all documents (1 point). Documents 1 through 7 are 
used as evidence of an African response, but discussion of Documents 8 and 9 simply restates what is in 
the source line, thus scoring only 1 point for evidence. Point of view is acceptable and used in two 
documents, 1 and 2 (1 point). The student develops two acceptable groupings: “respectful rejection” 
(Documents 2 and 3) and violent reaction (Documents 4, 9, 6, 7, and 5) (1 point). An additional document is 
requested, but the essay did not receive the point because there is no explanation of how the document 
would contribute to understanding an African response. 

Sample: 1C 
Score:  2 

The essay’s attempted thesis, located in the first paragraph, is unacceptable because it discusses only one 
response, rebellion. The student addresses all documents but misunderstands Document 8 (1 point). 
Evidence is provided for all but two documents, 1 and 8 (1 point). The student does not discuss point of 
view and explains only one grouping, a call to arms (Documents 7 and 6). The request for an additional 
document focuses on European actions and did not earn the point.
