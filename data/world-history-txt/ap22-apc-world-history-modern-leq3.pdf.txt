Question 3: Long Essay Question, Conflict and Religious Change 

6 points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.  

In the period circa 1450–1750, the global increase in transregional contacts led to both expansion and contraction of existing religions as well as the 
development of new religious practices.  

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which military conflict or conquest was the main cause of religious change in this period.

• 

“Peaceful proselytizing by Franciscan monks and 
Protestant missionaries in conquered territories 
contributed to the spread of Christianity.” (Uses 
multiple, specific pieces of evidence to support the 
argument regarding military conflict or conquest as 
the main cause of religious change in the period 
1450 to 1750) 
“In response to the Protestant Reformation in 
Europe, Spanish and Portuguese conquerors in the 
Americas strongly supported the spread of the 
Catholicism.” (Uses evidence to support the 
argument regarding military conflict or conquest as 
the main cause of religious change in the period 
1450 to 1750)  

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.  
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.  
(For example, the Ottoman Empire protected the rights of Jews through the millet system; Europeans fought wars of religion over the Reformation)

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Scoring Criteria 

Responses that do not 
earn points: 
•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning 
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument. 

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
does not use it to 
frame or structure an 
argument. 

Examples that do not earn 
points: 

Provide evidence but offer 
no reasoning to connect 
the evidence to an 
argument: 

• 

“The Ottoman Empire 
repeatedly invaded 
Southeastern Europe.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
explain how military conflict or conquest was the 
main cause of religious change in the period circa 
1450 to 1750 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the ways in which Islamic empires 
developed policies of religious tolerance. 

•  Explaining how European religious institutions often 

participated in European colonialism.  

•  Explaining how new religious practices developed 

as a result of cross-cultural contacts.  

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 
“Because of the Muslim principle of toleration of 
‘people of the Book,’ the expansion of Islamic 
gunpowder empires such as the Ottomans and the 
Mughals was generally accompanied by toleration 
of ethnic and religious minorities.” (Establishes a 
development that contributed to religious change 
in this period. This statement would need to be 
followed up with at least minimal discussion of the 
development introduced.) 

Responses that earn 2 points:  
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by demonstrating while Catholic 
priests often participated in Spanish colonialism, they also often 
criticized colonial policies such as the mistreatment of indigenous 
peoples. (Explains nuance, considers both causes and effects, and 
qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as demonstrating how competing efforts of territorial expansion 
by the Ottoman and the Safavid empires resulted in differing religious 
policies and increased conflict between Sunnis and Shiites. (Explains 
relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that while Islamic empires 
often tolerated religious minority groups, they also created laws that 
privileged Muslims socially, economically, and politically. (Qualifies an 
argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by showing how the religious tolerance of 
the Mughal Emperor Akbar and the British Queen Elizabeth I led to 
greater political stability. (Corroborates an argument, considers both 
causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 3—Long Essay Question 3 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to Long Essay Question 3 (LEQ 3) were expected to develop an essay that addressed the 
extent to which military conflict or conquest caused religious change in the period 1450–1750. The 
question addressed Topic 3.3 and closely aligned with Key Concept 4.1 of the AP World History 
Curriculum and Framework. The question was open geographically to allow responses from multiple 
areas with a specific tie to the period 1450–1750. Students were able to interpret the terms “conflict 
and conquest” in a variety of ways, including economic conquest and intellectual conflict. The 
question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the factors that led to 
the significant changes in world religions within this time period. Students were expected to present a 
historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the prompt, use at least two 
specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to support an 
argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their 
argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of 
the prompt. Successful responses compared religious change in different areas, explained causes for 
religious change, or discussed how religious changes continued and ended across the periods. 

Sample: 3A 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 6 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim in the last sentence of the introductory paragraph, with 
a claim that establishes a line of reasoning, “Military conquest of american empires by europeans 
was the main cause of religious change . . . through religious syncretism or assimilation, and 
suppression of native religions.”  

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the introductory paragraph by explaining a 
historical context for the prompt including a discussion of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the 
New World and the religious beliefs of the European and native populations prior to European 
arrival. 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points for evidence in the body paragraphs by using multiple specific pieces 
of evidence to support an argument. The response uses the “Divine Right of Kings” as evidence to 
support the argument that Europeans felt justified in converting Native Americans to Christianity. 
The cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe is used as evidence to support the argument concerning 
religious syncretism in the Americas. European bans of human sacrifice and “idolatry” as well as the

persistence of these practices “in secret” among Native American populations are used as pieces of 
evidence to support the claim that Europeans suppressed native religious traditions. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning for its overarching explanation of the causal 
connections between European attempts to impose Christianity in the Americas and the creation of 
syncretic religions in which “christianity changed or infiltrated into native religion and was 
commonly accepted.” 

The response earned 1 point for complexity for its nuanced argument regarding the extent to which 
military and political conquest influenced the spread of religion. For example, the response 
acknowledges how religious practice came from a European model of the Divine Right of Kings, 
while also noting that Europeans were not able to fully influence local religious practices. In 
addition, the response provides rich, accurate evidence throughout to support these arguments. 

Sample: 3B 
Thesis/Claim: 0 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 1 

Total Score: 3 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim. The attempt in the introductory paragraph (“In 
1450-1750 however, there was more of a global blend of religions and change of religion due to 
conquest of multicultural cities/empires”) is too vague to earn credit. There is no clear attempt at the 
end of the response.  

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The response does not describe a relevant 
historical context for an argument about conflict and religious change. The attempt in the first 
sentence of the introductory paragraph is too vague to earn credit. The discussion of the Mongol 
Empire and Neo-Confucianism in China (in the second paragraph) is not connected clearly enough to 
the topic of religious change within the time period specified in the prompt, so it was not credited 
toward the contextualization point.  

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points in the second body paragraph (on page 2) by using several specific 
pieces of evidence in support of an argument in response to the prompt. The evidence presented 
is that the [Catholic] “priests at the time had too much power in the government and this upset  
many Christians,” and the fact that “Martin Luther led the split of the two churches.” specifically. 
(Note the use of the terms “Catholic” and “Protestant” alone is not enough to indicate two separate 
pieces of evidence.) This evidence is used to support an argument that the Catholic-Protestant  
split, although “more of a beliefs issue . . . involved the government and some of their military.”

Question 3—Long Essay Question 3 (continued) 

The evidence presented in the first body paragraph regarding the Mongols and religious change is 
out of the time period of the prompt.  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because its discussion of the Catholic-
Protestant split successfully deploys causal reasoning to sketch out a narrative of some of the causes 
and effects of the Protestant Reformation. 

The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how conflict or conquest led to religious change. 

Sample: 3C 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 0 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 1 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim. Taken in totality, the paragraph presents claims that 
“religious missionaries” and “force” were two causes of religious change during the period 1450–
1750. This constitutes a minimally acceptable thesis claim and line of reasoning. 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The response does not describe a 
historical context for an argument about conflict and religious change.  

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 0 
The response did not earn points for evidence because there is no evidence provided outside of the 
thesis.  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning because it does not use historical 
thinking skills to frame an argument in response to the prompt.  

The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how conflict led to religious change.
