Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to parts (a) and (b) that would earn credit: 

•	  The Chinese imperial state, from the Han to the Tang, and, to some extent the Song, as it sought to 
expand its empire, came into contact with nomadic peoples from whom they continued to demand 
tribute and submission. 

•	  Nomadic peoples, because of their pastoral lifestyles, continued to rely on settled Chinese people 

for finished goods and products that they were unable to produce themselves. 

•	  Chinese imperial power, both economic and military, forced nearby nomadic peoples to submit, 

kowtow, and give tribute to the Chinese state throughout the period from the Han to the Tang and, 
to some extent, the Song dynasty. 

•	  The Chinese imperial belief in their own cultural superiority led them to consistently depict
 

nomadic peoples as inferior and needing to submit.
 

•	  Respectful relationships, identified in the drawing, between nomads and the Chinese represented 

Confucian ideals that were a continuity in imperial China.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•	  The tributary system, used by previous dynasties to pacify Central Asian nomads, was reversed by 
officials during the Qing dynasty, who used conquest and governance to dominate this region. 
•	  Mongolian nomads gained control over the Chinese imperial state rather than merely seeking trade 

opportunities, reversing the role they played in previous centuries. 

•	  The Khitan and the Jurchen, unwilling to maintain the old tributary relationship with the Chinese 
imperial state, defeated the Song, conquered portions of northern China, and forced the Song to 
pay tribute and recognize their dynasties as equals.

Short Answer Question 2 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“First and most important in the early modern era [1450–1750 C.E.] is the intensified human land use in 
every world region. Rising human numbers put increasing pressure on the land. Almost invariably [human] 
expansion caused a reduction in the quantity and diversity of vegetation or, to put it in other terms, a 
reduction in biomass and biodiversity. That is, sedentary cultivation depended on selection of one or a few 
favored plant species . . . in place of a variety of grass, shrubs, and trees. . . . Agriculture was and continues 
to be the single most important means by which humans change the world’s lands and its ecosystems. 

John F. Richards, historian, The Unending Frontier: An Environmental 
History of  the Early Modern World, 2003  

a) Identify and explain ONE historically specific example of  intensified human land use in  the period  1450– 

1750 C.E. that would support the  author’s  argument.  

b) Identify and  explain ONE historically specific example from the period  before 1450 C.E. in  which  humans  

interacted with the environment  in  ways  similar to those described in  the passage.  

c) Identify and explain ONE late-twentieth-century development that likely explains historians’ interest in  

the subject of  the passage.

Short Answer Question 2 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 
•	  The establishment of plantation agriculture in the Americas after 1492 resulted in new forms of 

intensive agriculture for cash crops for export, such as sugar, that reduced the agricultural diversity of 
the region. 

•	  The Aztecs altered the surrounding landscape through the use of chinampas in order to produce 

specific crops. 

•	  The Columbian Exchange dramatically changed the biodiversity and expansion of agriculture in Ming 

and Qing China through the cultivation of sweet potatoes, maize, and potatoes. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 
•	  The agricultural revolution in Mesopotamia resulted in intensive cultivation of cereal grains and use of 

irrigation, leading to increased salinization of the soil.  

•	  Greater rice cultivation and the spread of cash crops like tea and cotton during the Song Dynasty led to 

transformation of the landscape to meet the economic needs of the rising merchant class. 

•	  An agricultural revolution in medieval Europe led to the use of the three-field system, resulting in 

increased deforestation as more land was cleared for cultivation. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 
•	  The Green Revolution’s focus on increasing agricultural productivity in the 1960s led historians to 

consider other events or times when human agency also impacted the ecosystem. 

•	  The growing environmental movement of the late twentieth century brought greater attention to the 

damaging effects of deforestation and pollution. 

•	  The massive mobilization and relocation of people to increase agricultural production in China during 

the 1950s and 1960s led to environmental stresses.

Short Answer Question 3 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•	 

Industrialized nations pursued imperial expansion and political control over regions in Africa and 
Asia that had previously been independent. 

•	  The working class, which had traditionally been denied political power, gained influence as 

movements based on socialism, communism, and Marxism became more prevalent and more 
powerful in some industrialized regions. 

•	  Under pressure from unions and other workers’ movements, governments became active in 

improving working conditions and wages. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit:

Industrialization produced migrations of people, either to cities within industrializing areas or 
around the globe, to take advantage of new industrialization. 

•	  Pollution and poor living conditions resulting from industrialization led to movements to improve 

urban environments. 

•	  Traditional class structures had divided landowners and agricultural workers, but industrialization 
introduced a new divide between an industrial working class of factory laborers and a middle class 
of factory managers, professionals, and bureaucrats. 

•	  Women moved into factory jobs, which propelled the movement for additional women’s rights.

Thesis: Presents a thesis that makes a 
historically defensible claim and 
responds to all parts of the question. 
The thesis must consist of one or more 
sentences located in one place, either 
in the introduction or the conclusion. (1 
point) 

Argument Development: Develops 
and supports a cohesive argument that 
recognizes and accounts for historical 
complexity by explicitly illustrating 
relationships among historical evidence 
such as contradiction, corroboration, 
and/or qualification. (1 point) 

Notes 
•   Acceptable thesis statements must EXPLICITLY 
address a difference between at least one aspect 
of religious responses and at least one aspect of 
state responses to wealth accumulation in 
Eurasia during the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 1500 
C.E. 

Commonly seen examples might include:   

•   Religious and state responses to wealth 

accumulation differ in that religious responses 
encouraged the rejection of wealth to obtain 
salvation or create harmony, while state 
responses were to regulate the accumulation of 
wealth through administrative functions or 
state sponsored hierarchies. 

•   States responded to wealth accumulation by 

creating bureaucracies and laws that protected 
trade. This differed from religious responses 
which encouraged the wealthy to redistribute 
wealth and strengthen the religious 
organization.   

•   Students earn the point by noting that there are 
a variety of state and religious responses to 
wealth accumulation, while also corroborating 
the thesis statement or overarching argument 
consistently and cohesively throughout the 
essay with multiple pieces of evidence.

Question 1 — Document-based Question (continued) 

Document Analysis (Content): 
Utilizes the content of at least six of the 
documents to support the stated thesis 
or a relevant argument. (1 point) 
Document Analysis (Sourcing): 
Explains the significance of the 
author’s point of view, author’s 
purpose, historical context, and/or 
audience for at least four documents. (1 
point) 

Contextualization: Situates the 
argument by explaining the broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes immediately relevant to the 
question. (1 point) 

See document  summaries for details.  
•   Doc. 1: The Chronicle of Zuo, ca. 350 B.C.E. 
•   Doc. 2: Chanakya,  Arthashastra, ca. 250 B.C.E. 
•   Doc. 3: Cicero, Essay about Duties, ca. 50 B.C.E. 
•   Doc. 4: Gerontius, Life of Melania, ca. 450 C.E. 
•   Doc. 5: The Qur’an 
•   Doc. 6: Bezeklik Buddhist painting, ca. 800 C.E. 
•   Doc. 7: Ganapatideva, edict, ca. 1245 C.E. 

Commonly seen examples might include:   

•   Content (Doc. 1): The Chronicle of Zuo allowed 
Chinese merchants to accumulate as much 
wealth as possible so long as they didn’t try to 
topple the ruler. 

•   Sourcing (Doc. 1): It makes sense that Doc. 1 

would allow merchants to gain a lot of wealth in 
an attempt to preserve the political power of 
the ruler. The climate of fear at this tumultuous 
time likely caused the government to be more 
accepting of rich traders.  

•   Content  (Doc. 4):  The life of  Melania the 

Younger shows that Christianity  encouraged 
successful  merchants to give away their wealth  
to the needy and  to monasteries, as  was done 
by this saint.  

•   Sourcing (Doc. 4): Because the purpose of the 

biography was to tell a positive story about the  
life of Melania, Doc. 4 likely exaggerated  the 
amount of  wealth given away by the saint.  
This point  can be earned  by explaining historical  
events, developments, or 
before, during, or continue after the time frame of the 
question. 
Commonly seen examples might include:   

 processes that occur  

•   The rise of empires and the development of 

imperial administrations. 

•   The rise and spread of religions; foundational 

beliefs regarding salvation and living “the good 
life” of major religious traditions. 

•   The growth of interregional trading networks 
across Afro-Eurasia and corresponding rise in 
the economic and social  prominence of 
merchants.

wealth and economic success)  

•   Different  region (e.g., Aztec or  Inca policies 

such as road building or the pochteca system) 
•   Different theme (e.g., analysis of environmental 
factors that suggests that in some regions 
commerce was the predominant occupation, 
and argues that religions and states in such 
regions adapted to that situation)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

“Describe and explain a significant continuity and a significant change in labor migration in the period 
1450–1750 C.E.” (Historical thinking skill: Continuity and Change) 

Please note: 

•	  Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis 

without earning the point for thesis. 

•	  Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the 

student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the 
point for thesis. 

Scoring Criteria 
Thesis: Presents a thesis that 
makes a historically defensible 
claim and responds to all parts of 
the question. The thesis must 
consist of one or more sentences 
located in one place, either in the 
introduction or the conclusion.   
(1 point) 

Argument Development — 
Describes: Describes a historical 
continuity AND a change.  
(1 point) 

Notes 
•   Must address at least one continuity and at least 
one change in labor migrations and have some 
explanatory element for each. 

•   Does NOT have to mention specific migrations. 
•   Sample: A continuity during this period in labor 
migration was the forced movement of artisans, 
manual laborers, and prisoners by states to build 
empires, while a major change was the 
development of North American colonies where 
free, forced, and indentured migrant laborers were 
used to build new economies. 

•   Must describe/identify at least one relevant example 
of continuity and one example of change in labor 
migration in the period 1450–1750 C.E. 

•  Samples: European colonization of the Americas, 
regional migration within the Americas, trans-
Atlantic slave trade, importance of growing sea-
based trade networks shaping migrations. 

Argument Development — 
Explains: Explains the reasons 
for a historical continuity AND a 
change. (1 point) 

•   Must explain a cause for at least one relevant 

example of continuity and a cause for one relevant 
example of change in labor migration in the period 
1450–1750 C.E. and connect them back to the 
argument.

Addresses the topic of the 
question with specific examples 
of relevant evidence. (1 point) 

•   Must address the topic of the question by referring 
to at least TWO specific examples or pieces of 
relevant evidence reflecting labor migrations. Essays 
can earn this point without having a stated thesis or 
a relevant argument. 

•   Samples: trans-Atlantic slave trade, trans-Saharan 
slave trade, debt or indentured servitude in the 
Atlantic world, slavery in the Indian Ocean; free 
Europeans to the Americas, rural to urban 
migrations in Europe, Ottoman Empire slave 
soldiers, Chinese migrations throughout Southeast 
Asia. 

Using Evidence — Effective 
Substantiation: 
Utilizes specific examples of 
evidence to fully and effectively 
substantiate the stated thesis or a 
relevant argument. (1 point) 

•   Must both present a significant amount of relevant 
evidence and clearly and consistently link that 
evidence to an argument about continuity or 
change in labor migration in the period 1450–1750 
C.E. 

Synthesis: Extends the 
argument by explaining the 
connection between the 
argument and either a 
development in a 

•   different historical 

period 

•   geographical area 
•   a course theme and/or 
approach that is not the 
focus of the essay or 
•   a different discipline. 

(1 point) 

•  

•  
•  

•  

(Period) may offer a relevant connection between 
the in-period continuity and/or change in labor 
migration and developments in other periods, e.g. 
during 1750−1900 C.E. or 1945−2000. 
(Geography) not allowable because prompt is global. 
(Theme) may connect the continuity and/or change 
in labor migration in this period to a course theme 
or approach that is NOT economic history. 
Examples might include migrations driven by 
religious or environmental factors. 
(Discipline) may connect the argument to a different 
discipline, such as political science, sociology, or 
demography, to extend a discussion of the 
continuity and/or change in labor migration.
