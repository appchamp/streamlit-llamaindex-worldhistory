2017 AP®  WORLD HISTORY FREE-RESPONSE QUESTIONS 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“First and most important in the early modern era [1450–1750 C.E.] is the intensified human land use in every 
world region. Rising human numbers put increasing pressure on the land. Almost invariably [human] 
expansion caused a reduction in the quantity and diversity of vegetation or, to put it in other terms, a 
reduction in biomass and biodiversity. That is, sedentary cultivation depended on selection of one or a few 
favored plant species . . . in place of a variety of grass, shrubs, and trees. . . . Agriculture
be the single most important means by which humans change the world’s lands and its ecosystems.” 

 was and continues to 

John F. Richards, historian, The Unending Frontier: An Environmental 
History of the Early Modern World, 2003 

2.  a) Identify and explain ONE historically specific example of intensified human land use in the period 

1450–1750 C.E. that would support the author’s argument. 

b) Identify and explain ONE historically specific example from the period before 1450 C.E. in which humans 
interacted with the environment in ways similar to those described in the passage. 

c) Identify and explain ONE late-twentieth-century development that likely explains historians’ interest in the 
subject of the passage.

1.  Evaluate the extent to which religious responses to wealth accumulation in Eurasia in the period circa 600 

B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. differed from state responses to wealth accumulation. 

Document 1 

Source: The Chronicle of Zuo, one of the earliest Chinese historical works, composed during the Warring 
States period, circa 350 B.C.E. 

An ambassador from another [Chinese] state desired a jade ring that belonged to a merchant who resided in 
the Chinese state of Lu. So the ambassador begged Zi Chan, a Lu official, to have the ring confiscated from 
the merchant and given to him. Zi Chan, however, refused, saying, “One of our ancient rulers made a pact 
with the merchants in our state, to last through all generations. The pact said, ‘If you do not revolt against me 
[the ruler], I will not violently interfere with your commerce. I will not beg or take anything from you, and 
you may have your profitable markets, precious things, and substance, without my taking any knowledge of 
them.’ Through this attested covenant, our rulers and the merchants who live in our territory have preserved 
their mutual relations down to the present day. If you get the jade and lose a friendly state, wouldn’t that be a 
mistake?” 

The ambassador then changed his mind, saying, “I presumed in my stupidity to ask for the jade, which would 
have occasioned such a calamity. Let me now withdraw my request.”

Document 2 

Source: Chanakya, advisor to the first Mauryan emperor, Arthashastra, economic and political treatise, circa 
250 B.C.E. 

The Superintendent of Commerce shall monitor demand and the changing prices of various kinds of 
merchandise, both domestically produced and brought from other countries. He shall also determine the time 
suitable for the distribution, purchase, and sale of various kinds of merchandise. He shall avoid setting prices 
that allow for such large profits for merchants as to harm the people. 

All those who sell merchandise shall submit to the Superintendent their sale reports, saying “this much has 
been sold and this much remains”; they shall also hand over their weights and measures for inspection. 

The Superintendent of Commerce shall fix prices to allow a profit of five percent for local commodities and 
ten percent on foreign produce. Merchants who inflate the price even half a penny more than that shall be 
punished with a fine. 

Document 3 

Source: Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman statesman and philosopher, An Essay about Duties, circa 50 B.C.E. 

We generally accept as true the following statements about trade and occupations, in regard to which are 
suitable for gentlemen and which are vulgar. First, those occupations are condemned, which bring upon you 
peoples’ hatred, such as tax collecting and moneylending. Also vulgar and unsuitable for gentlemen are the 
occupations of all hired workmen whom we pay for their labor, not for their artistic skills. Also to be 
considered vulgar are retail merchants, who buy from wholesale merchants and immediately turn around and 
resell; for they would not make a profit unless they lied a lot. Of all the occupations from which profit is 
accrued, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more suitable to a 
free man. . . . 

When Cato [a Roman statesman well-known for his moral integrity] was asked what was the best form of 
property ownership he replied. “Raising livestock with great success.” And after that? “Raising livestock with 
little success.” And third? “Raising crops.” And when the person asking the questions said, “What about 
moneylending?” Cato replied, “What about murder?”

Document 4 

Source: Gerontius, Christian monk, The Life of Melania the Younger, a saint’s biography composed circa 
450 C.E. 

The blessed Melania [383–438 C.E.] and her husband Pinian both came from foremost [Roman] families of 
senatorial rank. But they resolved to abandon their frivolous and worldly mode of life and experience an 
angelic, heavenly purpose. They left the great city of Rome and went to their suburban estate, where they 
devoted themselves to the practice of the virtues. They knew that it was impossible for them to offer pure 
worship to God unless they made themselves enemies to the confusions of a wealthy life. . . . 

[Melania described their estate in the following manner:] “It was an extraordinary piece of property and in it 
stood a bath that surpassed any other in worldly splendor. The estate had a total of sixty-two settlements 
within its borders, with four hundred slaves. But I knew that it was the Devil who set before me those 
multicolored marbles, the villa, and all that inestimable revenue.” 

So the blessed ones fearlessly gave away all their possessions, which were enough for the entire world. They 
established monasteries of monks and nuns, furnishing each place with a sufficient amount of gold. They 
presented their numerous expensive silk clothes at the altars of churches and made many other offerings 
to God. 

Document 5 

Source: The Qur’an, the holy book of Islam 

O you who believe! Spend on others out of the good things you may have acquired, and out of that which 
God brings forth for you from the earth; and choose not for your charity things that you yourselves would not 
want or accept without averting your eyes in disdain. Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and 
bids you to be stingy, but God is infinite, all-knowing, granting wisdom unto whom He wills. Whatever you 
may spend on others, or vow to spend, God knows it; and those who do wrong by withholding charity shall 
have no one to comfort them. If you do deeds of charity openly, it is well, but if you bestow it upon the needy 
in secret, it will be even better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds.

Document 7 

Source: Ganapatideva, ruler of the South Indian Kakatiya state, edict, circa 1245 C.E.

By the glorious king Ganapatideva the following edict assuring safety has been granted to sea traders starting 
for and arriving from all continents, islands, foreign countries, and cities: 

Formerly kings used to take away by force the whole cargo—elephants, horses, gems, etc.—carried by ships 
and vessels which, after they had started from one country to another, were attacked by storms and wrecked 
ashore. 

But We, out of mercy, for the sake of glory and merit, hereby pledge to leave everything except the fixed duty 
to those who have incurred the great risk of a sea-voyage with the thought that wealth is more valuable than 
even life. 

The rate of this duty is one thirtieth on all exports and imports.
