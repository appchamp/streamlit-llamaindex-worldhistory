Short Answer Question 1 

Task: Short Answer Question 
Topic: Biran Mongol Conquests Secondary 
Max Score: 3 
Mean Score: 1.59 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was for students to analyze a secondary source document related to the role and 
impact of the Mongols in the period 1200–1450. In part A students were asked to identify one economic 
development that supported the author’s argument about Old-World integration. In part B the students were 
asked to explain how one piece of evidence challenged the notion that Mongol expansion marked a new era. 
Finally, in part C students were asked to explain how one intercultural transfer or exchange resulted from 
Mongol conquests. This question primarily addressed Topics 2.1, 2.2, and 2.5 of the AP World History: 
Modern Course and Exam Description. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Responses generally demonstrated their knowledge of the role of the Mongols in economic developments that 
connected the pre-modern (1200–1450) world, as well as the transfers/exchanges that resulted from these 
conquests. For many students, the Mongols, Silk Road trade, and other aspects of transregional trade during 
this era are aspects of the course that they understand and could identify. Many students recognized the role 
the Mongols played in securing, protecting, and promoting economic interactions in Eurasia. Many students 
credited early modern gunpowder empires, such as the Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, Qing, etc., for European 
maritime states as the architects of the “new era” rather than the Mongols.  

Students were also able to demonstrate their ability to analyze arguments and claims in a secondary source. 
Students had to know what Biran meant when mentioning the Mongol’s role in “integration of the old world” 
and “the first chapter of a new era.” With an understanding of his claims, students had to be able to show how 
evidence and examples might support or challenge these claims. Student response generally demonstrated 
strong understanding of the arguments and evidence to support.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Responses commonly introduced cultural rather than economic developments noting a common 
misconception between the difference of these categories of analysis. There were student responses that also 
referenced trade or the Silk Road but didn’t identify the Mongol role in economic development that promoted 
an “integration.” Both of the previous challenges point to the common issue of students not fully reading or 
understanding the prompt.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “Mongol toleration of local religion and 

•  “Mongol protection of merchants and 

customs led to greater ‘integration of the 
old world.’” (cultural rather than economic 
development) 

maintenance of trading infrastructure, such 
as roads and bridges, supported the growth 
of trade along the Silk Road routes.” 

•  “The Mongols were nomadic warriors 

who established territorial control through 
the rapid deployment of horse-mounted 
warriors and archers.” (Factually correct, 
but doesn’t address or challenge the idea 
of a “first chapter of a new era.”) 

•  “The Mongols were nomadic warriors who 
established territorial control through the 
rapid deployment of horse-mounted warriors 
and archers. These nomadic conquests mark 
the end of an earlier era. The first chapter of a 
new era would be marked by land-based and 
maritime gunpowder empires.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer 
teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Practice addressing the very specific nature of each task in a short answer question. Identify key words, as 
well as practice crafting responses that adequately identify, explain, or otherwise clearly address the verb 
task presented. 

Thematic vocabulary practice, such as “economic,” “transfer,” and “intercultural,” will assist students with 
being more precise and accurate in responses to the prompt. 

Work more with secondary sources and identifying lines of reasoning or arguments. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content 
and skill(s) required on this question? 

•  The Course and Exam Description provides a section on “Developing the Historical Thinking Skills 
and Reasoning Processes” on pages 180-191. This section provides examples of questions and

Short Answer Question 2 

Task: Short Answer Question 
Topic: Canton Factories Map 
Max Score: 3 
Mean Score: 1.03 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was for students to analyze a map that represented a plan of “Factories” in the city 
of Canton, Southern China, from 1856. In part A students were asked to identify one economic development in 
the period 1750–1900 that led to the “situation” or the factory system in Canton as represented by the map. 
Part B required students to identify one political development in the period 1750–1900 that led to the same 
“situation.” Finally, part C asked for explanation as to why the survey of the factories was carried out by the 
British Royal Navy. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Overall, responses struggled to address the course content related to the map of the Canton factories. 
Students discussed developments, such as the Industrial Revolution and Economic Imperialism, without 
describing the unique ways that these developments might have impacted the Canton trade or the role of 
China in shaping very controlled and regulated trade at its borders. Many responses were more successful 
in responding to part B, which asked for political developments in the period naming the Opium Wars, the 
growth of the British empire, or the Qing government’s rule in China.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Common misconceptions related to the term “factory” even though it was described as a warehouse. 
Students assumed the term meant manufacturing rather than a place for trade. Students used evidence from 
the 20th or 21st century instead of period-appropriate evidence, such as references to cheap labor for 
European businesses. Finally, students confused some elements of British imperialism, such as specific 
evidence related to India rather than its relationship with China during this period. Vocabulary, chronology, 
and geography continued to be issues for responses to this question. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “One economic development was the 
Industrial Revolution which had a shift
away from individual small-scale 
production to factory production with 
the formation of cities.” (not relevant 
to the question) 

•  “One political development leading to 

the situation in the map was the Opium 
Wars fought between European 
economic powerhouses and the Qing 
dynasty.”

•  “One economic development in the 
period that led to the situation in the 
map is industrialization. After the 
invention of machinery that did not 
require human labor, like the steam 
engine and textile machines, many 
places started moving away from 
agriculture.” (The factories in Canton 
developed prior to these developments 
of the industrial revolution) 

•  “The survey of the Canton factories 
was carried out by the Royal Navy 
because they were the ones who 
defeated China in the Opium Wars. The 
British and European powers began to 
control major cities and other trade 
centers like Hong Kong.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer 
teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

• 

Introduce students to the historical thinking skills and have them work in teams to identify the 
historical thinking skill prompted by the question. Have students peer review each other’s 
writing to identify when they are deploying one of the historical thinking skills. 

•  Work with students on how to interpret maps and other visual images and also how to write 

about them by referencing specific features or data they can draw from the prompt. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content 
and skill(s) required on this question?

Short Answer Question 3 

Task: Short Answer Question 
Topic: Columbian Exchange Crops 
Max Score: 3 
Mean Score: 1.69 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The responses to this question were expected to demonstrate understanding of the Columbian Exchange by 
identifying technological developments that caused or contributed to the trade network that was established. 
Part B required responses to identify a benefit of the transfer of crops and/or domesticated animals for the 
populations of people involved. Part C asked for an explanation of how the transfer of crops and/or animals 
would impact the environment. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Responses were successfully able to identify many relevant navigational technologies as developments that 
contributed to the Columbian Exchange including but not limited to lateen sails, the compass, and the 
caravel. Teachers are clearly teaching the Columbian Exchange and students understand its impact. 
Students were also able to identify the positive effects the exchange of new crops would have on people in 
the Americas and in Europe as they improved nutrition, which led to healthier longer lives in addition to 
increases in population size throughout Afro-Eurasia. Many students were also able to explain the 
environmental impacts the transfer of crops and/or domesticated animals would have, though these 
responses were typically limited to the Americas and focused on the effects intensive agriculture would 
have on the environment. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Student responses were very strong for this question. However, when there were misconceptions or gaps in 
knowledge there were a few patterns. For part A responses were unsuccessful when they used generalized 
phrases like “better” or “faster” to describe ships instead of identifying specific developments like the 
compass or astrolabe. One of the more common problems for part B was responses that lacked the “benefit” 
aspect of the question. These responses would identify something historically accurate but not necessarily a 
“benefit.” For example identifying “more food” as opposed to “more production of food, which led to 
population growth.” One of the common issues with part C was students would often overlook the 
environmental component of the question and/or not address how the environmental impact was a product 
of the transfer of crops and/or domesticated animals. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “Shipping improved and allowed 

•  “One of the developments that 

Europeans to sail to the Americas.” 
(Too general) 

contributed to the Columbian Exchange 
was the use of caravels with triangular 
sails.”

•  “One of the effects of the transfer of 
crops to the Americas was the use of 
the encomienda system and natives 
working on fields.” (does not address 
an environmental effect of the transfer 
of crops) 

•  “Because of the establishment of sugar 
plantations in the Americas and the use 
of intensive farming techniques to grow 
sugar there was a depletion of nutrients 
in the soil.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer 
teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

While students performed well on this question, many student responses failed to explain the effect crops 
and/or domesticated animals had on the environment and instead identified the effect on the environment. 
Taking the A.C.E. (Answer the question, Cite evidence, Explain the evidence) approach to each part of a 
Short Answer Question would help address these common issues. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content 
and skill(s) required on this question?

Short Answer Question 4 

Task: Short Answer Question 
Topic: Green Revolution Effects  
Max Score: 3 
Mean Score: 1.83 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate understanding of the Green Revolution. In part A 
students were asked to identify a scientific or technological advancement that contributed to the Green 
Revolution. Part B required an explanation of how the innovations of the Green Revolution benefited 
populations in the developing world. Part C required responses that explained how the Green Revolution 
impacted the environment within the developing world. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students who chose to respond to this question were able to identify many scientific and technological 
advances from the Green Revolution. The majority of the responses were relatively successful at connecting 
the content from the CED for this time period by identifying GMO’s, chemical fertilizers, and new crop 
varieties as technological innovations of the Green Revolution, as well as increased crop availability as a 
benefit to the populations of the developing world. 

This question provided the opportunity for students to demonstrate their ability to use historical causation 
when they responded to how the Green Revolution benefited populations and how the Green Revolution 
affected the environment. While students were often able to identify a food surplus as a benefit of the Green 
Revolution, on occasion they fell short of being able to connect it to how that surplus impacted populations 
of the developing world. In addition, many students could identify pollution as having a negative impact on 
the environment but did not fully explain how it was the result of the Green Revolution.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

One of the biggest gaps in knowledge was the idea that the Green Revolution and the Industrial Revolution 
were one in the same. Often students discussed factories and factory emissions as the cause of 
environmental damage. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “The Green Revolution affected the 

environment with greenhouse gasses, 
pollution and many environmental 
issues.” (This response did not explain 
– there was no causation.) 

•  “A practice during the Green Revolution 
that impacted the environment of the 
developing world was to cut down trees 
to make room for farming, this led to 
deforestation and the loss of wildlife 
habitat.”

•  “The Green Revolution benefited 

populations in the developing world by 
providing more food.” (This response 
does not explain how “more food” 
benefited people.) 

•  “By increasing the availability of food 
crops, populations in the developing 
world were able to increasingly prevent 
mass starvation.”

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Task: Document-Based Question 
Topic: Imperialism and Economies in Asia and Africa  
Max Score: 7 
Mean Score: 3.00 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
evidence provided by a select set of historical documents. The Document-Based Question (DBQ) asked 
students to evaluate the extent to which European imperialism had an impact on the economies of Africa 
and/or Asia. Responses were expected to address the time frame of the 19th through the early 20th centuries 
and to demonstrate the historical thinking skill of causation. The question addressed Topics 6.2 and 6.5 and 
Key Concepts 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 of the AP World History Course Framework. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Responses generally were successful in addressing the historical developments and processes referred to in 
the prompt and documents. Students were able to address the impact of imperialism on a wider level in 
discussions of regions as well as on an individual level. The majority of responses were familiar with the 
course content, CED Topics 6.2 and 6.5, and demonstrated that through discussions of imperialism in the time 
frame of the prompt. The skill of argumentation, as seen through the writing of thesis statements that made 
claims as to the extent to which European imperialism impacted the economies of Africa and/or Asia, was 
very successful for the majority of responses. Essays demonstrated the skill of making claims and providing 
evidence from the documents as well. Most students understood the documents and were able to use them 
successfully in their writing.  

Essays were less successful in demonstrating the skill of sourcing or providing the historical situation of the 
documents. The essays often attempted sourcing without moving beyond the language of the document itself. 
In addition, complexity in analysis was rarely attempted or successfully demonstrated.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Most responses had a clear understanding of imperialism but struggled with the application of the term in the 
theme of economics. There was a focus on the political aspects of imperialism and not economic effects. Many 
responses that attempted the skill of sourcing and situation only focused on the attribution of the source and 
lacked any explanation for how the sourcing impacted the document or an argument. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “In the 19th and 20th centuries, many 

advancements partook within the world. 
Europe increasingly and rapidly advanced 
technologically, contributing in its ability  

•  “Although people living in these regions had some 
alternatives to European economic dominance, 
European imperialism affected economics in Africa 
and Asia in the 19th and 20th by controlling huge

to be a superpower.” (The response does 
not identify the economic elements of 
context focusing instead on political and 
perhaps military growth without describing 
economic factors.) 

•  “Document 1 is from a manager of a 

government-run sugar factory in Java, so it 
is biased.” (The response does not provide 
the how or why the author’s point of view or 
purpose might have been influenced by the 
role that he played.) 

portions of trade opportunities and imposing harsh 
rule over labor.” (Demonstrates specific 
understandings of economic understanding.) 

•  “The historical situation of this document (4) is the 
rise of Cecil Rhodes’s diamond empire, stretching 
across most of Africa, Britain’s holdings in Africa 
drew much of its wealth from the mining of 
diamonds. Cecil Rhodes was a major aspect of this 
endeavor and profited greatly from it. This is 
important because it provides a backdrop that 
demonstrates the great economic ambitions of 
European powers.” (Provides significant how and 
why of the historical situation of document 4)

Question 2—Long Essay Question 

Task: Long Essay Question 
Topic: Pre-Columbian American States  
Max Score: 6 
Mean Score: 2.44 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to the Long Essay Question 2 (LEQ 2) asked students to evaluate the extent to which one pre-
Columbian state in the Americas was successful in consolidating its authority during the period before 1500. 
Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the 
prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to 
support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their 
argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the 
prompt. Successful responses that compared pre-Columbian states’ consolidation explained the reason for 
successful or unsuccessful consolidation, or discussed how consolidation continued and ended in the period. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students who selected this prompt demonstrated deep understanding of pre-Columbian American states. 
Essays were frequently able to provide numerous pieces of specific evidence in support of historical 
arguments. The majority of responses utilized causation as the primary historical reasoning skill and were 
able to forward a defensible claim or thesis that addressed the prompt. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Essays that were not as successful in responding to the prompt were unaware of geographic or temporal 
boundaries of the question. For example, students responded with examples of consolidation of state 
authority in Song China or the Mongol empire or referred to methods used by the United States or modern 
Mexico.  

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “The Chinese used the Silk Road to make 
the movement of troops easier.” (outside 
the geographic scope of the question)  

•  “The Aztecs used chinampas to grow large 

quantities of food for their population, which could 
be used as tribute to support the government.” 

•  “The American Revolutionaries 

•  “The Incan Empire was very successful in 

consolidated their power by breaking free 
from the British and creating a union of 
states that emerged from the original 
European colonies.” (outside of the 
temporal boundaries of the question) 

consolidating its power through the building of 
roads that allowed for the government to access 
different parts of the empire. The Carpa Nan 
allowed for the movement of troops, news, and 
trade.”

Question 3—Long Essay Question 

Task: Long Essay Question 
Topic: Contact and Religious Change 
Max Score: 6 
Mean Score: 2.26 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to Long Essay Question 3 (LEQ 3) were expected to develop an essay that addressed the extent to 
which military conflict or conquest caused religious change in the period 1450–1750. The question addressed 
Topic 3.3 and closely aligned with Key Concept 4.1 of the AP World History Curriculum and Framework. The 
question was open geographically to allow responses from multiple areas with a specific tie to the period 
1450–1750. Students were able to interpret the terms “conflict and conquest” in a variety of ways, including 
economic conquest and intellectual conflict. The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their 
understanding of the factors that led to the significant changes in world religions within this time period. 
Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the 
prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to 
support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their 
argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the 
prompt. Successful responses compared religious change in different areas, explained causes for religious 
change, or discussed how religious changes continued and ended across the periods. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students who successfully answered this question demonstrated a wide range of knowledge on the causes 
and processes of religious development in this time period. The largest number of students on the operational 
exam selected this question, which typically means that students felt confident with some knowledge of the 
period or subject. Essays mostly addressed Spanish conquest of the Americas as a key example of military 
force as a cause for religious change and typically responded with specific information tied to the arrival of 
conquistadors leading to the forced conversion of indigenous peoples to Catholicism. Another significant 
response path was an exploration of the Ottoman Empire, with frequent references to Janissaries as an 
example of force being used to change the practice of religion even under a generally tolerant government, or 
discussion of the conflict between Safavid and Ottoman reflecting how military conflict could both stem from 
and reaffirm religious divides. Students were generally successful in creating a thesis/claim for their 
argument, though these claims were sometimes vague or lacked a line of reasoning. Teachers have done an 
admirable job of introducing students to significant religious changes identified in the AP World History: 
Modern framework and Topic 3.3.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Students struggled slightly with deploying evidence in a way that supported their argument. Many essays 
presented a summary of religious knowledge or a vague response about the importance of religion without 
addressing the factors that lead to emergence, spread, or change. Chronology remained a significant 
weakness for students with arguments that centered on everything from the Crusades to the modern 
India/Pakistani split. Assisting students with placing their arguments within the period identified is 
important. General knowledge was strong, but for those essays that did not demonstrate a basic grasp in

understandings, such as the outcomes of the Protestant Reformation or the religious traditions of the 
Ottoman Empire, the essays typically achieved very few score points. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “In the period circa 1450-1750, the 

European Crusaders used military force 
to convert people to their religion.” 
(Misunderstanding chronology by 
including the Crusades in the period 
1450-1750.) 

•  “The Christian Crusades of the 13th and 14th 
century attempted to conquer the Holy 
Lands, laying groundwork for the strategy of 
using military might to spread Christianity. 
Once the Americas were “discovered” by the 
Europeans, the same concept of “crusading” 
for converts led to the Spanish conquistadors 
setting out on a crusade to convert the 
peoples of the Americas.” (Using the 
Crusades as appropriate context for the 
motivations of the Spaniards.) 

•  “The Spanish who came to the Americas 

•  “While military force was deployed, the 

converted everyone by force to 
Catholicism.” (This is inaccurate 
although true for some.) 

Spanish used a variety of methods to spread 
their religion including the development of 
mission system and using religious texts and 
practices in their general education of 
indigenous peoples in the Americas.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer 
teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Practice chronology. Have students keep a running timeline in their notes and add to it as you go, making it 
a point to discuss what came immediately before or immediately after an event. 

Encourage students to see nuance by asking them to consider and address exceptions to general 
statements. Developing a game or discussion structure of “yes, and…” where students are able to add to 
interpretations or examples will help to develop complexity and nuance. For example, teachers might write 
“Spanish converted by force.” Students then could offer the “yes, and…” through missions, education, and 
trade. 

Introduce students to and have them practice using historical terms, such as “circa.” Students who were 
unfamiliar with this term had trouble interpreting the time frame, thinking “circa” was a specific period 
itself—the “circa period.”

Question 4—Long Essay Question 

Task: Long Essay Question 
Topic: Twentieth-Century Free-Market Economics  
Max Score: 6 
Mean Score: 2.06 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to Long Essay Question 4 (LEQ 4) were expected to develop an essay that addressed the extent to 
which the spread of free-market ideas led to economic change in the late twentieth century. Students were 
expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the prompt, use at 
least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to support an 
argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their argument, and 
demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt. 
Successful responses compared economic change in different areas, explained causes for the adaptation or 
rejection of free-market economic ideas, or discussed how these economic changes were continuations or 
changes of previous economic trends. Most essays engaged the continuity/change historical thinking skill 
with a focus on late 20th-century developments covered in Topic 9.4 Economics in the Global Age. Students 
who engaged with comparisons mainly focused on a comparison of changes in the USSR and China in the 
late 20th century. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the 
responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Responses generally demonstrated some understanding of economic changes due to the exposure to free-
market ideas. Many successful responses addressed economic changes in China and/or the USSR. 
Teachers are clearly effectively introducing the concepts of globalization and multinational corporations as 
students frequently included these in their discussions of late-twentieth century economic developments. 
Many of the highest scoring responses addressed neocolonialism and the exploitation of the developing 
world as examples of negative consequences of exposure to free-market ideas as well as the practice of 
outsourcing labor to the developing world as part of globalization. A high percentage of students were 
successful in demonstrating their ability to write a thesis or claim relevant to the prompt. 

Frequently mentioned changes included the opening up of markets in China/USSR, and increased trade, 
especially in the previously addressed regions. Many students were successful in identifying context for the 
question, especially if they were able to accurately detail the economic differences between communism and 
capitalism. 

Responses at times were not awarded points because the information provided was too vague. While they 
might successfully utilize a historical reasoning skill to explain how the spread of free-market ideas led to 
economic changes, they at times did not provide enough detail to provide strong evidence. In this essay, 
students who selected the question were more commonly than expected able to attain complexity. Many 
responses earned this point by providing complex and nuanced understandings of the way in which 
outsourcing, expansion of multinational corporations, and other global economic developments impacted 
the economies of developing and developed countries differently. Students that were able to draw in this 
type of nuanced response of the changes that occurred did well overall on the essay.

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Chronology was again a common problem with responses as students provided answers with discussions of 
the early 20th century, the Industrial Revolution, or responding from a perspective of contemporary responses 
to global economic developments. Some responses also discussed the geo-political aspects of the Cold War 
without discussing the economy. Many students attempted to earn the contextualization but did not connect 
ideas from hundreds of years ago directly with the late-20th century developments. Specific evidence for the 
prompt was often lacking—understanding broad context but not deploying anything specific to support an 
argument. For example, noting the change in the USSR’s economy without mentioning perestroika or 
Gorbachev or other specific information of what and how those changes were made. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  “One example of the spread of free-

market ideas leading to economic change 
was the Great Depression. After the 
Great Depression many countries started 
to adopt free-market ideas in order to 
stimulate the economy.” (Outside of time 
period and untrue in many cases.) 

•  “As a result of being exposed to free-

market ideas many people in Beijing took 
part in demonstrations at Tiananmen 
Square in order to demand more political 
rights.” (Change is political not 
economic.) 

•  “One example of the spread of free-market 
ideas leading to economic change was the 
collapse of communism in the USSR. Mikhail 
Gorbachev implemented glasnost and 
perestroika, which allowed for greater access 
to information and a slight opening up on the 
economy. Therefore, people throughout the 
USSR and Eastern Europe were exposed to 
ideas about capitalism and put pressure on 
their governments to allow for greater access 
to consumer goods from the West.” 

•  “With greater globalization many businesses 
outsourced labor to other countries, like 
Mexico and India, where workers can be paid 
less than in places like the United States and 
Europe. Because they are competing with 
other multinational corporations around the 
world, this helps to lower the price of 
manufacturing goods so they can maximize 
their profits.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer 
teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Ensure students are addressing the prompt, paying attention to the time period and what is being asked of 
the student. Have students practice similar prompts and have student groups practice answering differently 
based on economic, political, and social categories. Share out responses based on category of analysis to 
compare how each is different. 

Practice incorporating specific pieces of evidence rather than vague references as arguments. The 
responses generally did a good job of addressing the prompt but did not provide specific evidence. Work

with students to brainstorm specific evidence that supports their argument, then require them to write just 
one paragraph and use 3-4 pieces of the evidence to support an argument. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content 
and skill(s) required on this question?
