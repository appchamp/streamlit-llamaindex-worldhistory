Question 4: Long Essay Question, Free-market Ideas and Economic Change 

6 points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.  

In the late twentieth century, the spread of free-market economic ideas led to numerous changes around the world.  

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the spread of free-market ideas led to economic change during this period.

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence:  
• 

“China and India liberalized their economies and 
adopted mixed socialist-capitalist economies in 
order to increase foreign investment and economic 
growth.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence 
to support the argument regarding how the spread 
of free-market ideas led to economic change in the 
late twentieth century) 
“International economic institutions like the IMF 
and World Bank required states to adopt free-
market policies in order to get loans or forgive 
debts.” (Uses evidence to support the argument 
regarding how the spread of free-market ideas led 
to economic change in the late twentieth century)  

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.  
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.  
(For example, the development of international institutions promoting free trade like the IMF; the development of individual nations transitioning into a free-
market economic system like Russia)

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Scoring Criteria 

Responses that do not 
earn points: 
•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning 
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument. 

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
does not use it to 
frame or structure an 
argument. 

Examples that do not earn 
points: 

Provide evidence but offer 
no reasoning to connect 
the evidence to an 
argument: 

• 

“Corporations like 
McDonalds and Coca-
Cola expanded to Africa 
and Asia.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
explain how the spread of free-market ideas led to 
economic change in the late twentieth century 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the way in which the end of the Cold 
War led to the spread of free-market ideas.  
•  Explaining how the development of multinational 
corporations expanded in developing nations. 
•  Explaining how the development of free-market 
trade affected regional or national economies.  
Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 

“As the Cold War came to an end, China and Russia 
restructured their centrally planned economies 
during the 1980s and 1990s in order to participate 
more broadly in the global capitalist economic 
system.” (Establishes a development that 
contributed to the growth of free-market trade in 
the relevant period. This statement would need to 
be followed up with at least minimal discussion of 
the development introduced.) 

Responses that earn 2 points:  
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by considering how outsourcing and 
the expansion of multinational corporations often helped to raise 
living standards in developing countries while also leading to job 
displacement in developed economies. (Explains nuance, considers 
both causes and effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 

such as explaining the ways in which the end of the Cold War 
contributed to the perceived triumph of liberal capitalist markets and 
the ways in which this often brought changes to former communist 
countries’ economies. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 
•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that although free-market 
economics spread in many parts of the world, criticisms of free-
market economics, often influenced by communist or Marxist 
traditions, endured. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by describing how several Pacific Rim 
states in Asia, such as South Korea and Taiwan, liberalized their 
economies in order to increase their exports and promote growth. 
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 4—Long Essay Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to Long Essay Question 4 (LEQ 4) were expected to develop an essay that addressed the 
extent to which the spread of free-market ideas led to economic change in the late twentieth century. 
Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context 
relevant to the prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt, use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning 
skills to frame or structure their argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of the prompt. Successful responses compared economic change in 
different areas, explained causes for the adaptation or rejection of free-market economic ideas, or 
discussed how these economic changes were continuations or changes of previous economic trends. 
Most essays engaged the continuity/change historical thinking skill with a focus on late 20th-century 
developments covered in Topic 9.4 Economics in the Global Age. Students who engaged with 
comparisons mainly focused on a comparison of changes in the USSR and China in the late 20th 
century. 

Sample: 4A 
Thesis/Claim: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 6 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim in the last sentence of the first paragraph with a 
historically defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning (“Although the spread of the free 
market encouraged industry in developing countries and the imposition of capitalism into Eastern 
Europe, ultimately the global economy remained the same in that the West retained its hegemony”). 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the first paragraph by relating the decline of 
communism in the USSR with the spread of free-market ideas. 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points for using multiple pieces of evidence to support arguments about the 
extent to which the spread of free-market ideas led to economic changes. Examples of evidence used 
in support of claims or arguments include the development of textile industry in Indonesia and 
Vietnam (used to support an argument that the spread of free-market ideas led to the spread of 
industrialization to more word regions), Gorbachev’s perestroika and its unintended effect of 
destroying the economy of the Soviet Union (used to support an argument that the spread of free-
market ideas led to the collapse of communism), and United States-based companies establishing 
production facilities overseas (used to support an argument that the spread of free-market ideas did 
not change the basic fact of United States and European hegemony over the global economy.

Question 4—Long Essay Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning by constructing a multi-faceted causal narrative 
illustrating how the spread of free-market ideas affected the developing world, the former Soviet 
bloc, and the global economy and overall led to greater industrialization. In addition to causal 
analysis, the response also develops arguments concerning both economic changes and economic 
continuities resulting from the spread of free-market ideas.  

The response earned 1 point for complexity because it includes multiple nuanced arguments 
throughout the essay to qualify the thesis/claim. The response identifies changes in parts of the 
world as a result of free-market ideas (“China became the world’s largest textile producers”) in the 
second paragraph and changes in Europe due to “economic liberalization” in the third paragraph. 
The response offers a nuanced argument concerning historical continuity and change, by arguing 
that, despite multiple changes, “the hierarchy of the world economy remained the same,” with 
Western Europe and the West maintaining “their economic dominance.” 

Sample: 4B 
Thesis/Claim: 0 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 1 

Total Score: 4 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim. The response identifies a historically defensible 
claim in the introductory paragraph (“The spread of free-market ideals to a large extent, led to 
economic change.”) but does not establish a line of reasoning.  

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the introductory paragraph. The response 
describes the free-market system of the United States and the communist system of the Soviet 
Union. 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points for evidence. Specific examples of evidence in the second paragraph 
include “trade of steel from China to the U.S,” the trade of “cars which are purchased by Americans,” 
and finally, the export of cars to “other countries like Japan.” These pieces of evidence are used in 
support of a claim that, as a result of the spread of free-market ideas, “all or most economies of the 
world interconnected (globalization).” 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning. Although the discussion of the global trade in 
automobiles (in the second paragraph) is quite rudimentary and overgeneralized, it nevertheless 
provides an outline of the causal connections between free trade and economic globalization.  
The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how the spread of free-market ideas led to economic change.

Question 4—Long Essay Question (continued) 

Sample: 4C 
Thesis/Claim: 0 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 1 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 1 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim because it does not provide a historically 
defensible claim about how the spread of free-market ideas led to economic change. There are 
attempts at a thesis in the introductory paragraph and in the concluding paragraph, but both 
statements are vague (“people were quite free with their economic choices” and the “free market 
helped majorly”) and neither establishes a line of reasoning. 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The response does not describe a 
historical context relevant to free-market ideas and economic change. 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for mentioning two pieces of evidence relevant to the spread of free-
market ideas or two to economic change in the late twentieth century. The first example of evidence 
is the discussion of the fall of the Soviet Union creating “opportunity for American business in 
Russia” (in the second paragraph). The second example is the passing reference to new consumer 
goods (“computers, phones”) related to “technology.” 

The response did not earn the second Evidence point (for using evidence to support an argument) 
because neither one of the two pieces of evidence included in the essay is clearly connected to an 
argument about free-market ideas and economic change. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning because it does not fully and effectively 
explain how the spread of free-market ideas led to economic changes. 

The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how the spread of free-market ideas led to economic changes.
