Question 1 

BASIC CORE (competence)    

1.  Has acceptable thesis 

      0–7 Points 

          1 Point 

•  The thesis must address a specific relationship between cricket and politics in 

South Asia, using evidence from the documents. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified  

conclusion  of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis cannot be counted for credit in any other category.  

2.  Understands the basic meaning of documents    
•  Students must address all 10 of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least nine 

                1 Point 

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to a specific relationship between cricket and politics. 

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without context 

does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document 

   2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of the relationship between cricket and politics 

must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine documents.  

•  Simply listing a document does not count as using the document as evidence.  

     For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of the relationship between cricket and politics 

must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents. 

•  Simply listing a document does not count as using the document as evidence.  

4.  Analyzes point of view in at least two documents   

          1 Point 

Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 
•  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular opinion, 

or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining a document’s tone, the 
characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion.  

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but 

must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing some 
plausible analysis.  

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.

2012 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

This question was intended to analyze the relationship between politics and the game of cricket in South 
Asia from 1880 to 2005. The question featured a rich variety of documents for students to use in their 
analysis of the relationship between cricket and politics. Rather than construing the term “politics” 
narrowly, the documents encouraged an interpretation of the political that extended beyond activities 
related simply to state functions or governmental institutions. The question invited responses that 
examined the role of cricket as a vehicle for articulating a variety of political aims, including British 
imperial objectives, emerging Indian nationalism, caste and religious rivalry, and competition between 
India and Pakistan. Most of the documents also provided helpful possibilities for discussions of point of 
view.  

Sample: 1A  
Score: 8 

The student presents a clear thesis in the introduction, focusing on how the game of cricket helped to ease 
tensions in the caste system and between Pakistan and India but did not always reduce tensions related to 
religious differences; the thesis is restated in the conclusion (1 point). The student addresses and 
understands all 10 documents (1 point) and uses them all as evidence (2 points). Point of view is clearly 
presented for Documents 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, and is attempted for Documents 4, 7, and 10 (1 point). The 
student groups the documents in three ways: class (Documents 2, 3, and 4), rivalry (Documents 1, 6, and 
10), and religious tensions (Documents 5, 7, 8, and 9) (1 point). There are two successful attempts at 
identifying the need for an additional document, each with clear explanations: one from a low-caste point 
of view and the other from a woman (1 point). The essay earned 1 expanded core point for the clarity of the 
thesis, multiple analyses of point of view, and strong requests for additional documents. Weak analysis of 
the documents kept the essay from earning the additional extended core score point. 

Sample: 1B  
Score: 5 

The student presents an extended thesis in the introduction of the essay, focusing on unity among castes, 
religions, South Asia, and England, as well as political gain and oppression (1 point). The student 
addresses and understands all 10 documents (1 point) and provides evidence from all of them (2 points). 
Analysis of point of view is weakly attempted but is acceptable only for Document 3, and therefore no 
points were earned. The student groups the documents in four ways: unity (Documents 4 and 5), equality 
(Documents 2 and 6), oppression (Documents 1 and 3), and politics (Documents 7, 8, and 9) (1 point). In the 
last paragraph there are two unsuccessful attempts at identifying the need for an additional document. 

Sample: 1C  
Score: 1 

The student presents an extended thesis in the introduction of the essay, focusing on the common ground 
that was developed between Great Britain and India over the sport of cricket, and a weak restatement in 
the conclusion (1 point). The student then proceeds to analyze, and use for evidence, only Documents 2, 3, 
and 4, and therefore did not receive credit for addressing all of the documents or providing evidence from 
at least eight documents. There are some rudimentary attempts at analyzing point of view for all three 
documents, but they are unsuccessful. There is no attempt at grouping the documents or identifying the 
need for an additional document.
