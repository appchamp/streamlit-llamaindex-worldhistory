Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically defensible 
claim about the ways in which communism, fascism, and/or 
nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social 
order during the twentieth century, with some indication of 
the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it 
must identify a relevant development or developments in the 
period. 

Note: Nazism should be considered a form of fascism. 

Examples: 
• 

“The political ideologies of communism, fascism, and 
nationalism became prominent during the 20th c. 
leaving many countries questioning their own 
governments. These challenged the existing political 
and social structures by offering new opportunities in 
the social order for those that were poor, and by 
promising sweeping political change to gain support of 
citizens.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative 
claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“Communist movements challenged the existing 
political order because communists believed in ‘All 
Workers Unite’.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the prompt 
(1 point) 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the ways in which twentieth-century 
political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or 
social order. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.  

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

Example: 
• 

“During this time, as Germany had to pay war 
reparations in response to losing the Great War, the 
country began to economically deflate and fall into a 
Great Depression.” (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the ways in 
which communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged 
the existing political, and/or social order during the 
twentieth century. 

Note: General assertions containing no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement should 
not be credited as “specific historical examples.”  

Example (acceptable): 
• 

“Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in which he outlined his Nazi 
ideology.” (Counts toward earning the point because 
there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt). 

Example (unacceptable): 
• 

“Fascism, a twentieth-century political ideology became 
one of the major challenges to the established political 
order in that century.”(Does not count toward earning the 
point because there is no specific information beyond 
what is provided in the introductory statement).  

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points)  

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt.  

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., Nazism 
challenged the political order; Communism did not), then the 
response can earn the second point by using only one specific 
historical example for each part of the multipart argument (but 
the total number of examples used must still be at least two).

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  The Bolsheviks’ nationalization and redistribution of 
property challenging the existing economic order by 
dispossessing former elites/capitalists and creating 
state-driven, planned economies 

•  Fascist ideology rejecting parliamentary democracy and 
individual rights liberalism and embracing instead a 
political system based on centralized personal 
leadership, propaganda, and the use of 
ultranationalist/racist policies 

•  The rise of nationalism in Asia and Africa challenging 

the global political order and leading to the 
reorganization or disappearance of European colonial 
empires 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the 
existing political and/or social order during the twentieth 
century. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how the ideologies’ ability to challenge the 

political or social order was facilitated by the two world 
wars 

•  Explaining how major changes of the political or social 
order in the twentieth century (e.g., the Versailles 
settlement or the Cold War) gave rise to new ideological 
challenges (e.g., Nazism, the Non-Aligned Movement) 

•  Explaining the effects of more than one ideology on the 

political or social order 

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about the ways in which 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism 
challenged the existing political and/or 
social order during the twentieth century. 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of prompt, 
using evidence to corroborate, qualify, 
or modify an argument that addresses 
the prompt (2 points) 

. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple 

factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an 
argument that some ideologies may challenge certain 
aspects of the established order while reinforcing other 
aspects (e.g., fascist governments’ support for big 
business)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the ways in which 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism 
challenged the existing political and/or 
social order during the twentieth century. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay 
to demonstrate awareness of historical complexity, 
such as constructing an argument that explains how 
Soviet and Chinese economic policies, while outwardly 
championing the rights of industrial workers or 
peasants (as mandated by communist ideology), ended 
up enriching the communist party elite, while leading to 
the impoverishment of workers and peasants 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how the effects of 
ideologies on the established order changed over the 
course of the century (e.g., nationalism being extremely 
disruptive of the established order in the first half of the 
century, but becoming tempered by international 
institutions and regional economic cooperation in the 
second half of the century). Or explaining how Social 
Democracy in Europe (after 1945) successfully blunted 
the extent of communism’s challenge to the established 
economic and political order by developing a system of 
mixed public-private economic policies and embracing 
parliamentary democracy

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on how communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the existing 
political and/or social order during the twentieth century, with some indication of the reasoning for making 
that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: Nazism should be considered a form of fascism. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The political ideologies of communism, fascism, and nationalism became prominent during the 20th c. 
leaving many countries questioning their own governments. These challenged the existing political 
and social structures by offering new opportunities in the social order for those that were poor, and by 

promising sweeping political change to gain support of citizens.” (Responds to the prompt with an 
evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The Cold War made it possible for decolonization movements to embrace both nationalism and 

socialism, thus challenging both the existing political order and the existing economic order.” 

(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

• 

“Communist movements challenged the existing political order because communists believed in ‘All 
Workers Unite’.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 

reasoning) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“Fascism was one ideology that completely disrupted the existing political order.” (Offers a historically 
defensible claim, but includes no additional information beyond what is provided in the introductory 

statement, and no indication of a line of reasoning)  

“The success of nationalist decolonization movements overhauled the established political and social 
order by ensuring that former colonial powers such as Britain, France, and the U.S. were no longer a 

factor in international relations.” (Not a historically defensible claim) 

“Communist governments in the Soviet Union and elsewhere usually nationalized factories, 
collectivized land in communal farms and invested in large-scale economic development projects (Does 
not respond directly to the prompt because there is no clear link to challenges to the existing political 
and/or social order) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 1900–2001. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which twentieth-century 
political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or social order. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical):  

• 

“Communism grew out of Marx and Engels’ observation that capitalism led to the mistreatment of 
factory workers by their bosses.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical):  

• 

• 

“Fascists rejected the teachings of liberalism.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a reference and does 
not meet the requirement of “describe”) 
“The twentieth century, especially after the end of World War I has been called the era of the nation-
state.”(Potentially relevant, but has no clear ideologies challenging the existing political and/or social 
order)  

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the ways in which

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social order during the 
twentieth century. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point 
for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.  

General assertions containing no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement 
should not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in which he outlined his Nazi ideology.”(Counts toward earning the point 
because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Fascism, a twentieth-century political ideology became one of the major challenges to the established 
political order in that century.” (Does not count toward earning the point because there is no specific 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or social order in the 
period 1900–2001. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: 

• 

“The Soviet Union tried to “export” communism to other countries by funding communist parties in 
Western Europe and in Asia and, after World War II, by establishing a large network of socialist client 

states, including Cuba, Vietnam, and Angola.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate 

support of an argument that addresses the prompt) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the ways 
in which communism, fascism and/or nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social order during 
the twentieth century. To earn this point the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent.

2018 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 4 — Long Essay Question 

Overview 

This question asked students to evaluate the role of communism, fascism, or nationalism, or any combination of 
the three, in challenging the political and/or social order of the twentieth century. Because the question prompt 
directed students to develop an argument that evaluates how one or more “of these political ideologies” 
challenged the established order, it was clear that the three ideologies listed in the introductory statement of the 
question were intended to present students with a definitive list of choices. The question was primarily designed 
to elicit responses covered under Key Concepts 6.2 and 6.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework. 
Although the time span of the question was defined as from 1900 to 2001, the topic also provided students with 
opportunities to demonstrate some crossover or background knowledge from the previous period (Key Concept 
5.1 for those choosing to discuss communism and Key Concept 5.3 for those choosing to discuss nationalism). 
The key understanding tested by the question concerned the ways in which ideologies have contributed to the 
many political and/or social conflicts, disruptions, and revolutions of the twentieth century. The question 
primarily targeted the historical reasoning skills of Causation and Contextualization and the history disciplinary 
practice of Argument Development, although, by virtue of presenting students with a list of ideologies on which 
to base their answers, the question also left the door wide open for deploying the reasoning skill of Comparison 
and, to a lesser extent, Continuity and Change Over Time. 

Sample: 4A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim. The response argues that nationalism, fascism, and communism 
inspire people to rise up.
