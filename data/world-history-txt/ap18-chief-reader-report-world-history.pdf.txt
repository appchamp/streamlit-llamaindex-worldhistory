Question #1 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 1 

Topic: Rummel Mass Violence 
Secondary Source:  

Max. Points: 3 

Mean Score: 1.32 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to be able to interpret an argument from a secondary source and 
identify or explain examples of mass violence committed by totalitarian and democratic states that would either support 
or undermine the author’s argument. Additionally, students were expected to explain a development in the late twentieth 
century (post-World War II) that likely shaped the author’s view of the relationship between democracy and mass 
violence. The question addressed Key Concepts 5.2, 6.2, and 6.3 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework, the 
historical reasoning skill of Contextualization, and the Disciplinary Practice of Analyzing Historical Evidence (Secondary 
Sources). 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

As the students largely interpreted it, this SAQ was rather Eurocentric and American-centric, so it did not always seem 
like a World History question. The best students gave non-Western responses that showed global knowledge and 
perspective, such as Pol Pot, Amritsar, or Rwanda. However, because of the prompt, most students seemed to default to 
European and American history. Indeed, United States History students could have done reasonably well on this 
question. The passage was from a U.S. author, so it was easier for students to default to American democratic examples. 
It is clear with this SAQ that students need further assistance in recognizing and analyzing POV. Students struggled the 
most with part c. Many students were not adept at connecting the views of the author to the historical events within the 
given time period to explain the author’s point of view. They would mention the Cold War, for example, but then lack the 
explanation required for the point that links that particular event to the author’s POV. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The SAQ largely addressed the twentieth century and while students do know a lot about the time period, sometimes 
students struggled with periodization. Some students wrote about Germany or Japan, and sometimes even the Soviet 
Union, as democracies to answer part b of the question. In addition, students did not always understand the reference to 
the late twentieth century and would cite earlier examples, such as World War I or World War II that would fall outside 
the designated time period. Most importantly, students did not always understand the distinction between violence 
committed within the context of war as opposed to “mass violence” committed against civilians or non-combatants or the 
difference between state-sponsored violence and individual violence or criminal activity. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

“Serbia during World War I was a democracy that 
facilitated the Armenian Genocide, in which 
thousands of Armenians were killed based on the 
whims of the higher-up government officials.” 
(Although the Armenian Genocide occurred during the 
First World War, Serbia did not perpetrate it.) 

• 

“The British Empire had control over Australia, 
which at the time was inhabited by the native people, 
referred to as Aborigines. When the British moved 
there they wiped out the majority of them leaving 
only a small percentage alive.” (The student correctly 
explains that the British Empire, a democratic state, 
used mass violence against the Aboriginal peoples of 
Australia.)

• 

“The reason that Rummel most likely believes this is 
because democratic states such as the United States 
fought against the states that committed these 
murders such as Germany and Rwanda.” (Although 
the actions of democratic states during the Second 
World War may have influenced Rummel’s argument in 
the passage, that conflict did not take place in the late 
twentieth century, which for the purposes of this 
question was defined as having taken place after 1950. 
Democratic states did not intervene in the Rwandan 
genocide of 1994.) 

“The rise of communism, which usually morphed 
into totalitarian government control in Russia, Cuba, 
China, and Cambodia among others likely caused 
Rummel to correlate communism with mass-
slaughters and democracy with no mass violence. 
This is probably supported by his seeing how 
democracies such as America, Great Britain, France, 
and Australia among others actively fought mass-
murdering regimes of the communists, whether 
directly such as in invading Cambodia or by Cold 
War political pressure.” (The student explains a 
potential reason why a United States political scientist 
writing in the late twentieth century would have argued 
that, unlike totalitarian states, democratic governments 
are not capable of engaging in mass violence.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

It is important for students to be able to deconstruct the prompt and think about what the question is asking for and avoid 
being led astray by catch phrases from the text (such as “checks and balances,” “serial murderers”). This can lead them 
to write about topics not relevant to the question, such as the death penalty, school shootings, or the criminal justice 
system. Teachers could also focus more on historical reasoning skills and disciplinary practices because students often 
understand historical content, but are unable to present the evidence in a way that will earn points for the response. For 
example, for this SAQ, students would often write historically accurate information on part C, but were unable to link that 
information to the author’s point-of-view. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

•  Teachers will find lessons on teaching the AP history disciplinary practice of analyzing secondary sources in the 

Teaching and Assessing modules, a link to which is found on AP Central. There are modules that focus 
specifically on the disciplinary practice of secondary source analysis in conjunction with course content that is 
also often a challenge for students. This module contains specific lessons that address analyzing historical 
evidence, videos explaining instruction for this practice, and examples of assessments and student responses for 
tasks whose skill focus is analysis of historical evidence.

•  The Teaching and Assessing modules on AP Central also contain a number of additional examples of short-

answer questions, along with commentary and notes on scoring student work.  

•  Teachers will find example responses from this question on AP Central, along with specific commentary 

explaining why each point was or was not earned. 

•  The instructional section of the AP World History Course and Exam Description offers another collection of 

resources for teachers that address each of the specific skills needed for the course. The section beginning on 
page 151 specifically addresses the disciplinary practice of analyzing historical evidence and provides 
suggestions for instruction.

Question #2 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 2 

Topic: Clive and Mughal Emperor 
Taxes Image  

Max. Points: 3 

Mean Score: 1.21 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify how Mughal tax concessions to the British East India 
Company (EIC), as demonstrated in an engraving by Benjamin West that depicts Robert Clive of the EIC receiving the 
right to tax three provinces from the Mughal emperor Shah ‘Alam II, reflected political changes in the global balance of 
power in the eighteenth century. Furthermore, students were supposed to explain how the same image reflected 
economic changes in Asia in the same century. Finally, students were asked to explain how Great Britain’s relationship 
with South Asia in the nineteenth century changed from the relationship depicted in the image. The question addressed 
Key Concepts 4.3 and 5.2 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of 
Continuity and Change and Contextualization. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

Students were able to demonstrate their knowledge of joint-stock companies, imperialism, indirect and later direct rule of 
South Asia [the British Raj], and South Asian anti-colonial resistance during the Sepoy Rebellion or Indian Mutiny of 
1857-1858.  Students were generally able to identify the change from powerful, sovereign Asian land-based empires like 
the Mughal Empire to growing maritime colonial powers like Great Britain in the eighteenth century. Students were also 
generally able to explain the change from indirect rule under the British East India Company to direct British imperial rule 
in the mid-nineteenth century. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Students were less comfortable discussing economic changes in Asia in the eighteenth century. Their knowledge of 
economic changes in the Atlantic World in the early modern era (1450–1750) was sometimes used to explain economic 
changes in Asia in the same period, which does not adequately explain the more gradual change in economic sovereignty 
and control of markets between traditional Asian states such as the Mughal Empire and competing European maritime 
empires like the British, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. Nineteenth-century knowledge of economic 
imperialism in China, Africa, and South Asia was also sometimes incorrectly used to explain economic changes in Asia 
as a whole, or in South Asia specifically in the eighteenth century. Students were also not as proficient in explaining 
change as they were in identifying change. Students need to better explain how or why something changes versus stating 
a fact without an accompanying explanation of how that fact demonstrates a change from a previous era, condition, or 
quality. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

“In the image, the Mughal Emperor is giving Great 
Britain the authority to collect taxes in India. Since 
Britain and the Mughals are both two powerful 
regions in that moment, it is clear that their 
interactions makes them both stronger.” (The 
statement is not historically defensible.) 

• 

“The image reflects political changes in the global 
balance of power in the 18th century by showing the 
greater political power European trade companies had 
on the areas they controlled. The British and Dutch 
trading companies arrived in Asian states and had the 
power to collect taxes, institute their own political 
leaders, and make decisions for the native population. 
European trade companies took over governmental 
roles in some Asian countries and shifted political 
global balance towards them.” (The student accurately

“A way in which the event depicted in the image 
reflects economic changes in Asia in the 18th 
century is that now Britain now boost their 
economy with tax revenue and trading. They are 
going to inspire countries like the Portuguese, 
Dutch, and French to come to Asia to seek goods to 
trade to boost their economy.” (The first part of the 
student’s response is not addressing economic change 
in Asia, while the second part is not historically 
defensible since the other European states mentioned 
did not come to Asia as a response to the British.) 

identifies a way that the image shows a shift in the global 
balance of political power.) 

“This event also depicts economic changes in Asia as 
joint-stock companies and sea trade empires increased 
and flourished. By monopolizing these places (British 
monopolizing India and the Dutch monopolizing the 
Spice Islands) they were able to gain more and more 
control over the economic production of these colonies. 
This is also an example of mercantilism as these 
companies became very rich by exploiting these Asian 
countries and forcing them to trade only with the joint-
stock companies, for more money. This led to [the] 
decline of the Asian colonies as it ruined their 
economy.” (The response explains how the growing 
economic power of European joint-stock companies led to 
greater European control over economic production in 
Asia and the economic decline of some regions in Asia.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should leverage their current practice of introducing early modern overseas trade in the Americas, specifically 
mercantilism, charter and joint-stock companies, and competition between states over trade routes, to fully explore the 
same process in Asia. Rich possibilities exist to compare the process of European colonialism and imperialism in the 
more commonly known story of the Americas with the less known but equally powerful story of Asia. Students do not 
realize the nuanced or more gradual economic changes in Asia. Additionally, teachers should have students practice 
explaining the how and why of changes or continuities in two to three sentences after identifying the basic change asked 
for in the question stems.

Question #3 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 3 

Topic: Nomads and Sedentary 
Societies pre-1450 

Max. Points: 3 

Mean Score: 1.14 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to demonstrate an understanding of the difference between how 
nomadic peoples and sedentary peoples in Afro-Eurasia adapted to their respective environments in the period before 
1450 C.E. Furthermore, students also needed to explain a similarity in the economic practices of both nomadic societies 
and sedentary states in Afro-Eurasia in the period 600–1450 C.E. Finally, students were expected to demonstrate an 
understanding of patterns of cultural interaction between nomadic societies and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia 
before 1450 C.E. The question addressed Key Concepts 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework 
and the historical reasoning skills of Comparison and Contextualization. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Student responses clearly demonstrated an understanding of the differences between nomadic and sedentary societies’ 
interactions with the environment, such as by explaining the greater mobility of nomadic peoples in Afro-Eurasia and 
sedentary societies’ greater reliance on agriculture, which encouraged them to make greater modifications to their local 
environment. Student responses also clearly demonstrated an understanding of long-distance or interregional trade and 
the use of coinage as shared economic practices. Finally, student responses demonstrated an understanding of the 
diffusion of culture, specifically the diffusion of religions such as Buddhism and technologies such as gunpowder that 
resulted from interactions along major trade routes. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most common misconceptions found in responses was a belief that bartering was the major form of economic 
exchange in the period 600–1450 C.E. and that the spread of patriarchy was a major cultural interaction between nomads 
and sedentary societies. Indeed, students clearly struggled with periodization and identifying ways in which trade was 
specifically practiced in the period between 600–1450 C.E. In addition, students also struggled coming up with specific 
examples that could help them earn points. For example, while many students mentioned that a religion spread or that 
nomadic and sedentary societies used the same religion, student responses needed to identify which religion spread and 
explain to some degree the process of its spread to show a transfer of ideals and beliefs from one group to the other in 
order to earn the point. When specific examples were used they demonstrated a broad base of content knowledge about 
the topics. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

“One major pattern of cultural interaction in nomadic 
and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia before 1450 
CE is nomadic people attacking sedentary societies 
for gain. Groups like the Mongols and other North 
Asian nomadic groups attached and controlled China 
like the Mongol-controlled Yuan dynasty.” (While the 
student correctly explains a major pattern of political 
interaction, the response does not explain a major 
pattern of cultural interaction.) 

• 

“A common trend was the religious diffusion of 
religions that were developed in sedentary societies 
by nomadic peoples through trade. With Buddhism, 
Central Asian nomads adopted these beliefs from 
India and facilitated it to China during the Han 
dynasty…” (The student explains a major pattern of 
cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary 
societies in Afro-Eurasia in the period before 1450 C.E.)

• 

“Both nomadic and sedentary societies based their 
economy with short distance bartering.” (Not a 
historically defensible claim.) 

• 

“Both nomadic and sedentary societies had a part in 
major land-based trade routes such as the Silk Road 
and the Sub-Saharan caravan routes. In the Silk 
Road, silk from China, textiles from the Middle East 
and horses from Central Asian groups were all traded 
across the continent…” (The student correctly explains 
how long-distance trade along major land routes was 
an economic similarity between nomadic and sedentary 
societies in Afro-Eurasia in the period 600–1450 C.E.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Overall, teachers did well in covering the content of periods 1-3 of the Curriculum Framework. There can, however, be 
improvement in helping students to understand the varied and diverse forms of nomadic societies. Beyond the Mongols, 
students had difficulty identifying a specific nomadic group. Additionally, teachers should continue to emphasize the use 
of language that makes clear which historical reasoning skill is being employed. For instance, using words and phrases 
such as “whereas,” “in contrast to,” or “likewise,” demonstrates that comparisons are being made. Finally, teachers 
should continue to help students find strategies for recognizing and understanding periodization.

Question #4 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 4 

Topic: Pre-1900 Agriculture Vs. Green 
Revolution 

Max. Points: 3 

Mean Score: 1.25 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, student responses were expected to identify a similarity and explain a difference between 
agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution of the twentieth century. Additionally, responses were 
expected to explain a political or social response to the Green Revolution during the twentieth century. The question 
addressed Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, 5.4, 6.1, and 6.3 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical 
reasoning skills of Comparison and Contextualization. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

Many responses did a good job of explaining the differences between agricultural practices and developments during the 
Columbian Exchange, the Industrial Revolution, and the Green Revolution. For example, many students pointed out that 
technologies developed during the Green Revolution were more sophisticated and helped produce far greater crop yields 
than in the period 1450–1900. In addition, many responses showed a very good understanding of the ways in which 
increased crop yields affect a multitude of other aspects of human society, such as health and population growth. 
Students were also able to identify and explain accurately the effect of the Green Revolution in India and Mexico in 
particular, but also in other parts of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Many students were confused about the Green Revolution and confused it with the Green Movement of environmental 
protection, recycling, and Earth Day. Many students also erroneously believed that people only grew small amounts of 
crops for their families or local markets in the period 1450–1900, or that mechanized agricultural production did not exist 
in the period 1450–1900 and only emerged in the twentieth century. Finally, many students cited demographic responses 
to (such as increases in human populations in the twentieth century) or environmental effects of the Green Revolution 
(such as protests against the expanded use of pesticides) instead of explaining how the Green Revolution elicited social 
or political responses. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“In the early times of agriculture in circa [1450–1900] 
they aimed to find plants and cultivate them for their 
family or be able to sell or trade with people for the 
crops. But in the Green Revolution we are trying to 
industrialize agriculture for large amounts of people.” 
(The student’s comparison of agriculture in the different 
time periods does not sufficiently explain a difference 
between them.) 

“Although some of the equipment used was similar 
one difference would be the much more highly 
advanced technology used during the Green 
Revolution. During the Green Revolution, scientists 
used genetically modified crops to help fulfill the 
needs of the people. Additionally, these genetically 
modified crops needed large amounts of chemicals 
and pesticides in order for them to grow and resist 
infection.” (The student explains how technology led to 
differences in agricultural production during the Green 
Revolution compared to the period circa 1450–1900.)

“One social response to the Green Revolution was 
the impact of the pesticides and chemicals used on 
the environment. These chemicals and pesticides 
began to build up in the water supply and people who 
drank the water were at risk. Moreover, the pesticide 
could negatively affect insect populations and the 
water contamination would result in a decrease in 
freshwater fish populations, leading to a decrease in 
biodiversity.” (Although the student correctly explains 
environmental consequences of the Green Revolution, 
the response does not explain a social response to the 
Green Revolution.) 

“One social response to the Green Revolution is the 
multitude of environmental protests that surfaced due 
to the massive increase in farming. People like 
Rachel Carson spoke out against the use of 
pesticides like DDT, as it was harming the local bird 
populations. This was one of the first major incidents 
of environmental protection, as the increase in 
pesticides and chemicals were harming the local 
animals, the surrounding water, and the land itself.” 
(Although the student describes many environmental 
consequences of the Green Revolution, the response’s 
discussion of protests against those consequences is 
sufficient to earn the point.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should point out to students that short-answer questions do not require long essays. Many students 
demonstrated their content knowledge in very long responses that had already earned the point in the first sentence or 
two. Further, teachers should explain differences in categories of analysis to their students, such as the differences 
between economic, demographic, political, cultural, or social developments. Finally, students should also be reminded to 
make sure that their responses directly address the prompt. Unfortunately, many students showed content knowledge 
that possibly could have earned them points, but their responses did not address the prompt.

Question #1 

Task: Document Based 
Question 

Topic: Railroads and Empire Building, 
1860-1918 

Max. Points: 7 

Mean Score: 2.49 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on historical 
documents. This DBQ asked students to evaluate the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in 
Afro-Eurasia between 1860 and 1918. The question addressed Key Concepts 5.1., 5.2., 5.4, 6.1., and 6.2. of the AP World 
History Curriculum Framework, with a particular focus on the topics of imperialism and nationalism, technologies 
associated with industrialization and their political effects, and international political and economic rivalries in the late 
nineteenth century. The question primarily addressed the Historical Reasoning Skills of Causation and Contextualization 
and the Disciplinary Practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence (Primary Sources) and Argument Development. The 
seven documents provided students with a opportunities to examine the effects of railroads written from multiple 
perspectives, including that of overseas European empires (British and French), an expanding overland empire (Russia), 
and Asian empires seeking to use railroads in their own modernization programs and to forestall European encroachment 
(Qing China and the Ottoman Empire). The documents also provided perspectives by both colonizers and colonial 
subjects, and addressed major inter-imperial rivalries such as the Scramble for Africa and the Great Game. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

The DBQ generally provided students with plenty of opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge of the content 
assessed by the question and of their mastery of the Reasoning Skills and Disciplinary Practices. The documents 
presented students with a good mix of perspectives on the issues addressed by the prompt and generally allowed for 
students at all levels of ability to earn some points. Students scored well on the Thesis point and on the two points for 
Using Evidence from the Documents, at least the lower level of evidence (3 documents described). Documents 4 and 6, 
with clear links to the theme of economic exploitation of colonies, were the most straightforward for students to use as 
evidence. The document on the Russian trans-Siberian railway (Document 5) and the document by a British army officer 
extolling the benefits of Indian railways (Document 7) were also used successfully by many students in constructing their 
arguments. Students were generally more challenged by the documents on the Ottoman Damascus-to-Mecca railway 
(Document 3), the use of railways in Qing China (Document 2), and the petition of higher-caste Indians regarding access 
to British-built railways in India (Document 1). The Contextualization point was earned by a sizeable number of students, 
with the historical development of railroads, the steam engine, and/or industrialization in Europe being the most 
frequently used contexts. The point for using Evidence Beyond the Documents, and especially the points for Sourcing the 
Documents and for demonstrating Historical Complexity, proved the hardest for students to earn. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

While many students did well with the economic argument about railroads facilitating European economic exploitation in 
Africa, only relatively few students developed arguments that showed understanding of the ways in which non-European 
empires used (or intended to use) railroads to defend against European imperialism. Many students struggled to 
understand the existence of “reformers” in both the Ottoman and Chinese empires (Documents 2 and 3). Only a small 
percentage of students were able to effectively analyze the cultural challenges that the building of railroads in India by the 
British brought among native Indians, as well as the frictions railroads generated between Indians and the British 
(Document 1). Sourcing the Documents, Using Evidence Beyond the Documents, developing arguments that demonstrate 
Historical Complexity, and—to a lesser extent—Contextualization were the areas where students demonstrated skill gaps. 
A great many essays did not even attempt sourcing, and of the ones that attempted it, many did not do it well. Possibly as 
many as 15-20% of the essays still requested additional documents, which has not been part of the rubric for the past few 
years.

“Document 2 is relevant because the author and his 
P.O.V. was objective and he simply knew what was 
best for China because he was an official and well 
educated in those subjects.” (The attempt to provide 
sourcing for the document does not meet the threshold 
of adequately explaining how the author’s point-of-view 
influenced his argument.) 

“Document 1 is a petition from high-caste Indians to 
the British government in 1866 and addresses the 
problem that second-class and third-class 
[passengers] are not given due respect when on 
trains. They claim, ‘the miseries suffered equal the 
horrors of the Middle Passage,’ referring to the 
transportation of slaves accross the Atlantic Ocean.” 
(Fails to earn the point for Evidence Beyond the 
Documents because it is merely a passing reference 
glossing a term mentioned in one of the documents.)

“As a government project, railroads also helped 
foster a sense of nationalism. As shown in document 
3, released by the Ottoman government, likely from 
the perspective of economic gain political [relevance] 
(in a time where their global influence had been 
diminished by European technology) - the railroad 
from Mecca to Medina, the 2 holy Muslim cities, 
would foster a sense of community across the Dar [al-
Islam].” (Successfully sources the document by 
explaining how the historical situation affected the 
argument made in the document regarding the role of 
railroads in the process of empire-building.) 

“Railroads were also built in Southern Africa by the 
Voortrekkers and other settlers to the same end, 
allowing for easy movement of individuals and 
resources. Typically, this use of railroads was seen 
early on, while still exploring/colonizing or 
establishing control.” (Earns the point for Evidence 
Beyond the Documents by describing an additional 
piece of evidence not found in the documents, and 
clearly linking that evidence to an argument about the 
prompt.)  

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

In regards to DBQ skills, teachers need to improve their own understanding and teaching of the skill of sourcing 
documents. More students need to see sourcing in the documents and those that attempt it need to improve how they 
describe sourcing. Sourcing by Historical Situation is an untapped opportunity. Multiple documents in the 2018 DBQ lent 
themselves to this type of sourcing and very few students took advantage. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

•  Teachers will find lessons on teaching the disciplinary practices and the historical reasoning skills associated 
with the DBQ in the Teaching and Assessing modules, a link to which is found on AP Central. These modules

Question #2 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 

Topic: Spread of Religions, 600 B.C.E. 
to 600 C.E.  

Max. Points: 6 

Mean Score: 1.91 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the factors that contributed to the 
emergence or spread of one or more religious traditions in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. The question addressed 
Key Concepts 2.1. and 2.3. of the AP World History Curriculum Framework, focusing on both the process of formation 
and codification of religious traditions and the process of spread of religions via networks of communications and 
exchange. The question primarily tested students’ ability to deploy the Historical Reasoning Skills of Causation and 
Contextualization and the History Disciplinary Practice of Argument Development. Students were not, however, limited to 
using the skill of Causation, and we saw successful responses demonstrating historical understanding by comparing 
religions or evaluating the changes in the spread of religions over the course of the time period. The question was open 
geographically to allow responses from multiple areas, with a specific chronological tie to the classical era. Three 
religion/belief systems were presented to students as examples in the wording of the prompt (Buddhism, Confucianism 
and Christianity), however students could address any religious system that arose or spread during the time period 
specified in the prompt. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

Although many students performed well on this question, it proved to be a difficult question overall. Only approximately 
23 percent of students taking the exam chose to answer this question. Students who chose Question 2 overwhelmingly 
developed essays that addressed trade as a main factor in the expansion of religions, and typically responded based on 
the three religion/belief systems presented in the prompt. Very few essays addressed the emergence of religions. 
Students were generally successful in creating a thesis/claim for their argument, though these claims were sometimes 
vague. Teachers have done an admirable job of exposing students to the core religions/belief systems mentioned in the 
question (Buddhism, Christianity and Confucianism), and many students did a good job of presenting some factual 
evidence about the religions. Specific mention of Emperor Ashoka’s role in the spread of Buddhism, for example, or of the 
role of the apostles in the spread of Christianity were common. Students also demonstrated an understanding of the 
concept of cultural diffusion and did a good job of explaining how trade on the Silk Road led to exposure to and 
expansion of religions. Students struggled slightly, however, with deploying this evidence in a way that supported their 
argument. Many students instead presented a summary of religious knowledge, or a more vague response about the 
importance of religion to culture without addressing the factors leading to emergence and spread. Students who 
recognized the role of trade in regard to this prompt tended to earn more points, however the great majority of students 
struggled to earn the points for demonstrating historical reasoning and historical complexity.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Students struggled with meeting the specific expectation of the prompt to address factors leading to the emergence or 
spread of religion. Many students responded with vague statements about the general rise of religion “in response to 
need for something to believe in,” or provided faith statements about their own beliefs rather than construct a historical 
argument about the emergence or spread of religions. Another frequent misunderstanding was seen in responses that 
simply summarized various religious beliefs without addressing factors leading to either the emergence or the spread of 
the belief systems. Students also struggled to earn the contextualization point. In part, that was because the broad nature 
and the early time period of the question left students few opportunities to contextualize beyond the prompt. Successful 
contextualization attempts were sometimes found within the body of the essay and often had to do with contextualizing 
specific factors for the spread of religion (for example developing a brief explanation of the Silk Road and its importance 
as a trade route before explaining how it also became a factor in spreading religion).

“During Period 2, 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., many 
religions began to spread. Before then regions just 
continued to practice whatever they wanted to 
believe in. Period 2 is a time where new modes of 
transportation came about and cities or countries 
began trading goods with other cities/countries.” 
(This attempt at contextualization is unsuccessful 
because of the lack of specificity in situating the spread 
of religion in the context of broader historical 
developments.) 

“Another trade route that influenced religion [in the 
period 600 B.C.E to 600 C.E.] was the small amount 
of trading occurring in the Indian Ocean. It was small 
amounts of trading, nothing like the Columbian 
Exchange, but it got the spread of religious belief 
across waters.” (This is an example of the way many 
responses attempted to offer connections to 
developments across time and space by simply 
mentionining or identifying those developments without 
explaining the connections between them and the main 
argument about the spread of religions in the period 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.)

• 

“After a period of Warring States in China to help 
stabilize the country laws based [on] Legalism were 
put into place. The utter brutality made that approach 
a complete disaster and a new answer was sought 
after. Confucianism seemed at that point to take root. 
Chinese people were eager for a new set of morals 
after the destructive mark of Legalism was left, which 
made them more susceptible to Confucianist ideas.” 
(This contextualization attempt was successful because 
it situated an argument about the emergence of 
Confucianism in a historical context that was described 
with a sufficient degree of accuracy.) 

“Overall, what caused the spread of religions and 
belief systems was the trading of ideas, the work of 
missionaries and monks, and the power and 
influence of the government. And not only is this 
seen with Buddhism, Christianity, and Confucianism, 
but also with Islam. The prophet Muhammad first 
had his revelation, then spread it through trade and 
[then] his followers spread it through missions until 
eventually the whole government of the Middle East 
was Islamic.” (Compared to the unsuccessful example 
on the left, this offers a much more effective explanation 
of connections between the topic of the prompt and 
developments in a later time period; combined with a 
clearly articulated argument supported by detailed and 
specific evidence, this statement contributed to the 
essay earning the Historical Complexity point.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

It is important for teachers to provide opportunities for students to support an argument with specific details. One 
possibility is to have students write an LEQ response in class, under testing-situation conditions, and then provide a 
specific time for them to go back to their essay and (using resources such as their book) list the specific facts that could 
have been used to respond to the question. This allows students to see the difference between a vague response and the 
concrete evidence they should have used to support their argument. A similar technique could be used to develop 
contextualization skills. One exercise for this is to provide a prompt for students, but only require a contextualization 
response, or to develop a contextualization together as a class. Students benefit from repeated modeling of this skill in 
class, and the opportunity to connect their knowledge to other topics similar to the prompt.

Question #3 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 

Topic: Columbian Exchange Effects - 
Americas  

Max. Points: 6 

Mean Score: 3.04 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The question allowed students to demonstrate their knowledge of the effects of the Columbian Exchange on peoples in 
the Americas in the period 1450-1750. The question primarily addressed Key Concept 4.1. of the AP World History 
Curriculum Framework, with some crossover possible (but not required) into Key Concepts 4.2. and 4.3. The main key 
understanding tested by the question concerned the various impacts of the global interconnectedness that followed the 
European exploration, conquest, and settlement of the Americas. The question primarily targeted the Historical 
Reasoning Skills of Causation and Contextualization and the History Disciplinary Practice of Argument Development, 
although responses that demonstrated historical understanding by deploying the Reasoning Skills of Comparison and 
CCOT were also credited. The phrase “peoples in the Americas” in the question prompt was interpreted to mean Native 
American peoples or European settlers or African slaves (or any combination of those groups), and the question did not 
specify any particular category of effects (e.g. demographic, cultural, etc.). Therefore the question presented students with 
a very broad spectrum of opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge of any effects of the Columbian Exchange on the 
Western Hemisphere. 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

Students did very well on the Thesis and Evidence points of the rubric (including the point for providing specific 
examples relevant to the topic of the question and the point for supporting the thesis or argument with evidence. 
Students’ success in earning these points showed that students are generally very familiar with the fundamental aspects 
of the Columbian Exchange and its impact on the peoples of the Americas. As expected, fewer students were able to 
successfully score points for the higher order historical skills. This included the point for Contextualization and especially 
the second Historical Reasoning (or “complexity”) point. Students had somewhat greater success in earning the first 
Historical Reasoning point and they typically accomplished that by being able to frame their responses around the 
Reasoning Skills of Causation (the most common approach), CCOT (a fairly common approach), or Comparison (a rarely 
seen approach). Organizing essays systematically around a Reasoning Skill often distinguished the more analytical 
responses from those that listed historical facts or developments but fell short on explanation and evaluation. Students 
generally struggled to earn the Contextualization point, which was a bit surprising for a development such as the 
Columbian Exchange which is so firmly rooted in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and standard AP World 
History instructional practices. It seemed as if many students were still attempting Synthesis (often by presenting cross-
period comparisons or analogies) rather than attempting to situate the Columbian Exchange in its historical context. 
Those that succeeded in earning the Contextualization point, however, often did so either by situating the Columbian 
Exchange in the context of European merchants’ growing exclusion from Mediterranean and Asian markets through the 
policies of Asian states or empires or, alternatively, by showing how the isolation of pre-Columbian American societies 
had made them vulnerable to the devastating effects of disease and labor systems introduced by Europeans. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Generally speaking, students had a good and accurate understanding of the facts of the Columbian Exchange. 
Misconceptions on this particular question included: a) confusion regarding the direction in which products were traded 
across the Americas (e.g., some students claiming that potatoes and corn were introduced to the Americas); b) attempts to 
construct thesis statements merely by qualifying the effects of the Columbian Exchange on the Americas either as 
“negative” or “positive” for the people of Americas, without providing any discernible line of reasoning. The assertion 
that it was “positive” was often based on the misconception that the people of the Americas were somehow not as 
developed (e.g., had poor diets, had no religion, did not have clothing) as Europeans. Other common knowledge gaps 
seen in the responses had less to with factual/content misconceptions and more to do with students not being sufficiently 
trained in the demands of the new LEQ rubric.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  Even though the Columbian Exchange brought some 
negative effects to the Americas, the Americas were 
greatly influenced by these exchanges. (The attempted 
thesis does not provide any indication or reasoning for 
the assertions made in the statement.) 

• 

“Over time, America has progressed and slavery and 
mass death of the Indians is something we seek out to 
fix. America has moved away from slavery but there is 
still discrimination present today. From that point, we 
have had many Revolutions, Resolutions, and laws to 
make America the country it is today.” (Statements 
such as this one, which attempted to earn the 
contextualization point by discussing developments from 
later periods were rarely successful.) 

• 

• 

“From 1450 [to] 1750, the Columbian Exchange led to 
the development of new inter-racial relationships 
resulting in a social hierarchy. It also led to religious 
syncretism by the native population as they took on 
some of the European Catholicism, as well as [to] the 
spread of diseases such as the smallpox in the 
Americas which killed many native people.” (This 
thesis statement received credit because it makes a 
historically defensible claim in response to the prompt - 
in fact, three historically defensible claims - and 
establishes a line of reasoning.)

“In 1453, Sultan Mehmet II led the Ottoman Turks and 
invaded the city of Constantinople. This cut of[f] 
Europeans from trade with China and its luxury goods 
like porcelain and silk. To avoid being double taxed by 
both the Venetians and Ottomans to reach China, 
explorations were sent out to find a new way to 
China.” (Despite some oversimplification of the effects of 
the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, this statement 
provides an excellent, content rich description of a 
relevant context in which to situate the essay’s 
argument.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should discuss with their students not only the basic aspects of contextualization, but also why this skill is 
fundamental to historical inquiry. A world history course such as this—one that emphasizes trans-regional interaction—is 
rooted in global contextualization, which in turn should be reflected in student writing. Such was often not present in 
student responses. There still remains a focus on specific, discreet events or individuals that fails to acknowledge larger 
historical processes that serve as the backdrop for these events. Put another way, students should fully comprehend that 
the Columbian Exchange occurred parallel to and was integrated with other trans-regional processes. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question?

Question #4 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: Ideologies Effects on 
Political/Social Order 
Mean Score: 2.45 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The question asked students to evaluate the role of either communism, or fascism, or nationalism, or any combination of 
the three in challenging the political and/or social order of the twentieth century. Since the question prompt directed 
students to develop an argument that evaluates how one or more “of these political ideologies” challenged the established 
order, it was clear that the three ideologies listed in the introductory statement of the question were intended to present 
students with a definitive list of choices. The question was primarily designed to elicit responses covered under Key 
Concepts 6.2. and 6.3. of the AP World History Curriculum Framework. Although the time span of the question was from 
1900 to 2001, the topic also provided students with opportunities to demonstrate some crossover or background 
knowledge from the previous period (Key Concept 5.1. for those choosing to discuss communism and Key Concept 5.3 for 
those choosing to discuss nationalism). The key understanding tested by the question concerned the ways in which 
ideologies have contributed to the many political and/or social conflicts, disruptions, and revolutions of the twentieth 
century. The question primarily targeted the Historical Reasoning Skills of Causation and Contextualization and the 
History Disciplinary Practice of Argument Development, although, by virtue of presenting students with a list of 
ideologies on which to base their answers, the question also left the door wide open to deploying the Reasoning Skill of 
Comparison and (to a lesser extent), Continuity and Change Over Time (CCOT). 

How well did the response address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate 
the skills required on this question? 

Most of the responses to the question focused on the political ideologies of fascism and communism as challenges to the 
existing political and/or social order in the twentieth century. Relatively few responses discussed the impact of 
nationalism. Responses focusing on the challenges posed by socialism typically demonstrated a good command of the 
relevant course content – for example, by offering largely correct accounts of Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, by explaining 
the expansion of communism as a political ideology during the Cold War (e.g. to China, Vietnam, North Korea, or Cuba), 
or by analyzing the effects of communist ideology on the societies of communist countries (e.g. the policies in the USSR 
and Communist China to nationalize industries, suppress political dissent, and create more egalitarian social structure). 
Responses that focused on the effects of fascism also usually demonstrated a good understanding of the relevant facts, 
with most of them pointing to the great disruption to the political order represented by the Second World War. A smaller 
number of responses successfully discussed the social effects of fascism (usually German Nazism) in terms of its impact 
on the relationship between individual and society and its emphasis on racial or ethnic purity. The responses reflected a 
number of Historical Reasoning Skills: Causation, Comparison, and Continuity and Change Over Time. For example, 
many responses discussed the First World War and the Great Depression as key factors to the rise of fascism in Italy and 
Germany. Other responses compared the fascist regimes of Mussolini and Hitler in Italy and Germany, while others 
contrasted the communist policies of Stalin and Mao in Russia and China. Generally speaking, the Thesis point and the 
two Evidence points were accessible for students, with over a third of the responses earning the Thesis point and a 
majority earning the first Evidence point. Contextualization was also a point that many responses earned successfully, in 
large part because the First World War (and, to a lesser extent, the Great Depression) provided an obvious backdrop for 
many possible responses to the questions. The two points for Historical Reasoning – especially the second (or 
“Complexity”) point – were far and away the most difficult for students to earn. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Few essays focused on the process of decolonization in Asia and Africa in comparison to the bulk of the responses 
devoted to fascism and communism. As such, many students may have missed an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge 
that they probably had by not associating decolonization with nationalism. Many of the responses that did discuss 
nationalism seemed to use the term merely as a synonym of patriotism or were loosely integrated into larger arguments 
about fascism in Germany. While the responses that chose to discuss fascism usually accurately associated historical

figures such as Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco with their respective regimes, these responses were not as consistently 
clear on the political goals of fascism. Some of the responses on communist policies in either the Soviet Union or China 
continued to offer vague and inaccurate criticisms of the consequences of this political ideology. Several responses 
offered general and unsophisticated statements about the failures of communism due to laziness or lack of financial 
incentives to work harder. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“Nationalism is a very strong tool. Culture 
consumes our lives and it consumed Ayatollah 
Khomeini’s people in Iran where they have a 
theocracy. A government that mixed religion into 
politics. Nationalism was also a cause of the World 
Wars. Every country thinks [they are] the best, then 
they acted upon it.” (This is an example of the many 
responses that struggled to integrate nationalism and 
its effects into their arguments.) 

“Looking more into the present 21st century, as the 
United States was involved with military conflict in 
the Middle East, a terrorist group retaliated with 
fascist/nationalist ideals. On September 11th, 2001, 
a plane was hijacked and crashed into the World 
Trade Center, Pentagon, and almost the White 
House, but still crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. 
This violent attack was to cause terror and challenge 
the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan/Middle East, 
after all, challenging the political order. They wanted 
to pride themselves as a group and keep the political 
ideologies to how they react to certain events, 
causing mass destruction to foreign political order.” 
(A fair number of responses attempted to link their 
arguments to post-2001 events. While it would have 
been possible to use the 9/11 attacks as a historical 
parallel of a disruption to the political and social order, 
this particular attempt was unsuccessful because it 
does not show an understanding of the ideological 
underpinnings of political Islam/al-Qaeda.) 

• 

• 

“In addition, the rise of nationalism particularly in 
colonial regions dramatically changed the political 
and social order. After World War II, the European 
powers lost their global prestige, which allowed 
colonies throughout the world, particularly in Afro-
Eurasia, to fight for independence. Nationalism 
surged in regions like India and South Africa was 
well as other places. In India, led by Mahatma 
Gandhi, the movement for independence was non-
violent and heavily backed by nationalism. … In 
South Africa, nationalism spurred the black Africans 
to end apartheid and elect Mandela as the first black 
president of South Africa.” (This is a successful, well-
argued, evidence-rich integration of nationalism into 
the argument, showing awareness of the role of 
nationalism in the process of decolonization.)

“Communism posed a uniquely strong challenge to 
the political order of the twentieth century, 
especially after the USSR came out on the winning 
side in WW2. After communism fell many expected 
that democracy was the way of the future for all 
countries, but that has not quite played out. 
Nationalists are still a strong force all over the world 
(something that became clear in the breakup of 
Yugoslavia and in the Rwanda genocide). Also we 
have seen the rise of dictators through democratic 
systems such as Putin in Russia and the Turkish 
president.” (This statement successfully 
connects/compares the challenges that communism 
posted to the global political order of the 1900-2001 
period with challenges to the global order posed by 
post-Cold War nationalism and populist 
authoritarianism. In combination with similar 
statements and in the context of a multifaceted essay 
well supported by evidence, the statement helped earn 
the point for historical complexity.)

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer to teachers to help 
them improve the student performance on the exam? 

To demonstrate historical thinking and complexity, teachers should continue to teach students strategies as to how to 
deploy historical thinking skills such as causation, comparison or change over time. Teachers should continue to help 
students develop a thesis/claim in the opening paragraph and work with them on sustaining the argument throughout the 
entire paragraph. Although each score point is evaluated on its own, the essay should offer a cogent argument across 
multiple paragraphs. Doing so might be particularly beneficial to students in earning the first argument development 
point. Last but not least, teachers should encourage students to think about their thesis/claim as part of a larger 
conversation. In other words, any given response establishes a line of reasoning that should be aware of the other ways 
people might interpret the prompt and craft arguments in response to counterarguments.
