Question 3 — Long Essay Question 

“In the period 1450−1750, oceanic voyages resulted in the Columbian Exchange, which transformed the 
Eastern and Western Hemispheres.  

Develop an argument that evaluates how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in this 
time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning (1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must make a 
claim that responds to the prompt, rather 
than merely restating or rephrasing the 
prompt. The thesis must consist of one or 
more sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.  

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically defensible 
claim about how the Columbian Exchange affected 
peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750, with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but 
it must identify a relevant development or developments in 
the period. 

Note: The phrase “peoples in the Americas” may mean 
Native American/Amerindian peoples OR Africans or 
Europeans living in the Americas during the time period. 

Examples: 
• 

“The Columbian Exchange had a profound impact on 
the Americas most notably by diversifying American 
populations through migrations of Europeans and 
enslaved Africans, but also by introducing new crops 
and domesticated animals.” (Responds to the prompt 
with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange had a negative effect on 
peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750 
because many of them died from European diseases.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable 
claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 

• 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the effects of the Columbian Exchange 
on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.  

Example: 
• 

“It is generally believed that the Americas were first 
settled by people from Siberia, who then remained 
isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of 
years.” (Relates broader events and developments to the 
topic)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the impact of 
the Columbian Exchange on peoples in the Americas in 
the period 1450–1750. 

Note: General assertions containing no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement should 
not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example (acceptable): 
• 

“Europeans’ attempts to reach Asia by sailing west 
resulted in Europeans’ encountering the Americas.” 
(Counts toward earning the point because there is a 
specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example (unacceptable): 
• 

“The Columbian Exchange was a direct outcome of the 
European oceanic voyages.” (Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement) 

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points)  

To earn the second point the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., the Columbian 
Exchange had a detrimental impact on Native Americans but 
a beneficial impact on Europeans settling in the Americas), 
then the response can earn the second point by using only 
one specific historical example for each part of the multipart 
argument (but the total number of examples used must still 
be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  The introduction of Eastern Hemisphere diseases such 
as measles and smallpox leading to sharp declines in 
Amerindian populations soon after the arrival of the 
Europeans. 

•  The transfer of horses and cattle allowing Europeans 
to make a living in the grasslands of North and South 
America thereby driving out Native peoples living in 
these areas. 

•  The adoption of American crops (such as corn and 
potatoes) and Amerindian agricultural techniques 
(such as the milpa or altitude-dependent agriculture in 
the Andes) allowed both European immigrants and 
enslaved African populations in the Americas to grow.

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about how the Columbian 
Exchange affected peoples in the 
Americas in the period 1450−1750 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how the 
Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in 
the period 1450−1750. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how historical isolation led to peoples in 
the Western and Western hemispheres developing a 
different set of agricultural crops and practices, as well 
as different technologies and biological/immunological 
characteristics 

•  Explaining how the population transfers following the 
European exploration and settlement of the Americas 
led to the technological, agricultural, and biological 
transfers of the Columbian Exchange  

•  Explaining the differential impacts of the processes of 
the Columbian Exchange on Amerindian, European-
American, and African-American populations in the 
Americas 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of the 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt (2 points) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how the Columbian 
Exchange affected peoples in the 
Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple factors or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument that complex processes 
such as the Columbian exchange could have different, 
sometimes disparate, effects on peoples in the 
Americas (for example, the demographic catastrophe 
in the aftermath of the initial contact versus the longer-
term increased economic activity because of plantation 
agriculture) 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
explains how the processes of the Columbian 
Exchange had both intended and unintended effects 
(for example, the deliberate introduction of Afro-
Eurasian crops and domesticated animals versus the 
unintended transfer of pathogens, disease vectors, and 
invasive species)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how some of the 
effects of the Columbian Exchange (the demographic 
effects from the transfer of pathogens) happened 
relatively quickly, while other effects (the demographic 
and ecological effects from the adoption of new crops) 
happened over many decades or centuries, or 
explaining significant regional variations in the effect 
of the Columbian exchange on peoples in the 
Americas, such as the near complete population 
collapse of Amerindian populations in the Caribbean 
versus the more limited impact in the major population 
centers in Mesoamerica and the Andes

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in the 
period 1450−1750. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: the phrase “peoples in the Americas” may mean Native American/Amerindian peoples OR Africans or 
Europeans living in the Americas during the time period. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange had a profound impact on the Americas most notably by diversifying 
American populations through migrations of Europeans and enslaved Africans, but also by introducing 
new crops and domesticated animals.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes 
a line of reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange had a negative effect on peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750 
because many of them died from European diseases.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally 
acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange transformed the lives of peoples living in the Americas in the period 
1450−1750.” (Offers a historically defensible claim, but includes no additional information beyond what is 
provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange affected the Americas by wiping out the Indians and giving Europeans an 
empty continent in which to settle.” (Not a historically defensible claim)  
“A strong desire to spread Christianity led Europeans to launch their transoceanic voyages in the 
1400s.” (Does not respond directly to the prompt because there is no clear link to the Columbian Exchange) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 1450–1750. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the effects of the Columbian 
Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“It is generally believed that the Americas were first settled by people from Siberia, who then remained 
isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years.” (Relates broader events and developments to 

the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“Smallpox, influenza, and plague were ‘Old World’ diseases.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a 
reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe”)  
“The Inca in South America, and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica had built the two largest Native American 
empires by 1450.” (Potentially relevant, but has no clear link to the Columbian Exchange) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the effects of the 
Columbian Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. These examples of evidence must 
be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

General assertions containing no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement 
should not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Europeans’ attempts to reach Asia by sailing west resulted in Europeans’ encountering the 
Americas.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange was a direct outcome of the European oceanic voyages.” (Does not count 

toward earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the 

introductory statement) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in the period 
1450−1750. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: 

• 

“Within a few years of their arrival in Mexico and Peru, Spanish priests and conquistadors began to 

notice that large numbers of Indians were dying of infectious disease. Illustrated Aztec and Inca 

chronicles from the first years after the conquest also show many people sick or dying from smallpox. 
There were also outbreaks of measles and typhoid. Native Americans died from these diseases in 

disproportionately high numbers, which resulted in a dramatic decline in their populations across the 

Americas.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses 

the prompt)  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the effects 
of the Columbian Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. To earn this point the 
response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the 
reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining how historical isolation led to peoples in the Eastern and Western hemispheres developing 

a different set of agricultural crops and practices, as well as different technologies and 
biological/immunological characteristics

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•  Explaining how the population transfers following the European exploration and settlement of the 

Americas led to the technological, agricultural, and biological transfers of the Columbian Exchange  

•  Explaining the differential impacts of the processes of the Columbian Exchange on Amerindian, 

European-American, and African American populations in the Americas 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the ways in which the Columbian 
Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750 by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, 
or modify an argument that addresses the question.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include:  

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 

perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that complex processes such as the 
Columbian exchange could have different, sometimes disparate, effects on peoples in the Americas. 
(For example, the demographic catastrophe in the aftermath of the initial contact versus the longer-
term increased economic activity because of plantation agriculture) 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that explains how the processes of the Columbian

variations in the effect of the Columbian exchange on peoples in the Americas, such as the near 
complete population collapse of Amerindian populations in the Caribbean versus the more limited 
impact in the major population centers in Mesoamerica and the Andes.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question 

Overview 

This question allowed students to demonstrate their knowledge of the effects of the Columbian Exchange on 
peoples in the Americas in the period 1450–1750. The question primarily addressed Key Concept 4.1. of the AP 
World History Curriculum Framework, with some crossover possible (but not required) into Key Concepts 4.2 
and 4.3. The main key understanding tested by the question concerned the various impacts of the global 
interconnectedness that followed the European exploration, conquest, and settlement of the Americas. The 
question primarily targeted the historical reasoning skills of Causation and Contextualization and the disciplinary 
practice of Argument Development, although responses that demonstrated historical understanding by deploying 
the reasoning skills of Comparison and Continuity and Change Over Time were also credited. The phrase 
“peoples in the Americas” in the question prompt was interpreted to mean Native American peoples or European 
settlers or African slaves (or any combination of those groups), and the question did not specify any particular 
category of effects (e.g., demographic, cultural, etc.). Therefore, the question presented students with a very 
broad spectrum of opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge of any of the effects of the Columbian Exchange 
on the Western Hemisphere. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for the thesis/claim because the statement “The Columbian Exchange led to new 
social hierarchies as races began to mix and the spread of disease and religious practices to the native 
population” is both historically defensible and establishes a line of reasoning related to the prompt.  

The response earned 1 point for contextualization. Contextualization occurs throughout the first paragraph, 
where the response describes how disruptions in trade in the Mediterranean and high taxes levied by the 
Venetians on trade to India and China compelled European explorers to “find a new way to China,” which in turn 
helped to create the Columbian Exchange from 1450 to 1750. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence because the argument that racial intermarriage “created new 
social hierarchies” is supported by multiple pieces of evidence (Creoles, mestizos, mulattoes, and Peninsulares.) 
Evidence (smallpox, influenza, horses) is also used to demonstrate how diseases “killed much of the native 
population, eventually resulting in a lack of labor.”  

The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning, which can be found in the second and third 
paragraphs. The discussion on the effort to end the “cruel Encomienda system” and the discussion of those 
people who were at the “bottom” of a “new social hierarchy” demonstrates the use of historical reasoning 
(causation) to frame an argument. 

The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because the essay’s three body 
paragraphs build up to a multifaceted argument about the effects of the Columbian Exchange. Complexity of 
argument and depth of historical knowledge and applicability are evident in the abundant corroborating evidence 
and explanation.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 3 

The response earned 1 point for the thesis/claim because it makes the following claims: “In the Americas during 
the period 1450–1750 [the Columbian Exchange] greatly affected the social structure of the area. New forms of 
political rankings were added. New forms of coerced labor were added and new ideas were formed by the 
people.” These statements adequately provide a defensible claim regarding the societal and political structures in 
the Americas. 

The response did not earn a point for using contextualization because the argument that Enlightenment ideals 
“encouraged the Haitian revolts against Spaniards at the sugar cane farms” is historically inaccurate (France, not 
Spain). A point could have been earned if the response had discussed how Enlightenment ideals spread from 
Europe and influenced Haiti’s revolt against France. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence because the response includes multiple examples (mulattoes, 
Creoles, mestizos, slave trade from Africa, slaves, and Christianity) to support arguments regarding “new social 
rankings” in the Americas, new “forms of coerced labor,” and the introduction of new ideas to the Americas. 
Support for the argument is evident throughout each of the three paragraphs. 

The response did not earn the point for using historical reasoning because no attempt is made. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding because no attempt is made to 
construct historical complexity. 

Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

The response did not earn the point for the thesis/claim because the statement, “Even though the Columbian 
Exchange brought some negative effects to the Americas, the Americas were greatly influenced by these 
changes,” does not provide a specific reason as to how the Americas were impacted negatively. To earn this 
point, the response needed to include a specific example or examples of how people of the Americas were 
negatively affected by the Columbian Exchange in the period 1450–1750. 

The response did not earn the point for contextualization because the statement that the Columbian Exchange 
brought “pizza which comes from Italy but has been modified through the years in the Americas” does not 
explain how people were impacted by such an occurrence and refers to a time period that is not adjacent to the 
period 1450–1750. 

The response earned 1 point for using evidence because there are numerous examples of evidence (spices, rum, 
slaves, corn, cocoa, squash, European culture) related to the impact of the Columbian Exchange on the peoples of 
the Americas. Though the essay contains multiple examples of evidence, the response does not use these pieces 
of evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt. 

The response did not earn the point for using historical reasoning because no attempt is made to construct 
historical reasoning.
