Document 3 

Source:  Two women recalling their girlhoods working in Japanese textile factories, circa 
1900. 

From morning, while it was still dark, we worked in the lamplit factory till ten at night. 
After work, we hardly had the strength to stand on our feet. When we worked later into  
the night, they occasionally gave us a yam. We then had to do our washing, fix our hair, 
and so on. By then it would be eleven o’clock. There was no heat even in the winter; we 
had to sleep huddled together to stay warm. We were not paid the first year. In the second 
year my parents got 35 yen,* and the following year 50 yen. 

-  -  - 

Soon after I went to work in the factory, my younger sister Aki came to work there too.  
I think she worked for about two years, and then took to her bed because of illness. At  
that time there were about thirty sick people at the factory. Those who clearly had lung 
troubles were sent home right away. Everyone feared tuberculosis and no one would come 
near such patients. Aki was also sent home, and died soon after. She was in her thirteenth 
year. Aki had come to the factory determined to become a 100-yen worker and make our 
mother happy. I can never forget her sad eyes as she left the factory sickly and pale.

Document 4 

Source:  Buddhist priest from a rural area of Japan from which many farm girls were sent 
to work in the mills, circa 1900.  

The money that a factory girl earned was often more than a farmer’s income for the entire 
year. For these rural families, the girls were an invaluable source of income. The poor 
peasants during this period had to turn over 60 percent of their crops to the landlord. Thus 
the poor peasants had only bits of rice mixed with weeds for food. The peasants’ only 
salvation was the girls who went to work in the factories.  

Document 5 

Source:  Tsurumi Shunsuke, Japanese industrialist, circa 1900. 

Where do the cheap workers come from? They all come from farming communities. 
People from families that are working their own land, or are engaged in tenant farming  
but have surplus workers, come to the cities and the industrial centers to become factory 
workers. Income from the farms provides for the family needs and subsistence of the 
parents and siblings. The person who takes employment in the factory is an unattached 
component of the family. All he or she has to do is earn enough to maintain his or her  
own living. That is why the workers’ wages are low. This shows how important a force 
agriculture continues to be for the development of our nation’s commerce and industry.

Document 6

1916. 

For the last few decades there has been a rapid decline of the handwoven cloth industry 
throughout the country on account of the competition of machine manufactures. Though 
many still wear clothing made from cloth woven on handlooms, large numbers of 
handloom weavers have been abandoning their looms. 

The local textile industry owes its very existence, promotion, and growth to the 
enterprising spirit of native bankers and investors, who invest large capital as  
shareholders, investors, and financiers.

Document 9 

Source:  Report of the British Royal Commission of Labour in India, Calcutta, 1935. 

Most of the workers in the cotton mills are recruited from among the small peasants and 
agricultural laborers of the villages, along with unemployed hand weavers. They live in 
small rented huts. The average worker remains in the same factory for less than two years. 
Wages are low, and there has been no significant change in wages over the last decades.
