BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.

•  The thesis correctly specifies BOTH continuity and change in patterns of 

interactions along the Silk Roads from 200 B.C.E. to 1450 C.E.

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay. 
•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs or merely restates the prompt is

thoroughly. 
For 2 points: 

•  Essay addresses BOTH continuity AND change in patterns of interactions along  

the Silk Roads with historically relevant specificity. 
For 1 point: 

•  Addresses EITHER continuity OR change in patterns of interactions along the  

Silk Roads with historically relevant specificity.

•

3.   Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 

2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Provides at least five pieces of accurate evidence of continuity AND change 

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 
o  Each piece of evidence must be a supporting example of continuity OR change  

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 

o  Examples: religions, disease, economic systems, technology, animals, products. 
For 1 point: 

•  Partially substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 
•  Provides at least four pieces of accurate evidence of continuity AND/OR change  

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 
o  Each piece of evidence must be a supporting example of continuity OR change  

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 

4.   Uses relevant world historical context effectively to explain  

1 Point 

continuity and change over time. 

•  The essay relates or describes an extraregional connection or a global process to  
explain a continuity OR change in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads.  
o  Example: “Over a period of time, Silk Roads were responsible for bringing different  

cultures into contact” is NOT acceptable because of the lack of specificity. 

•  Using “relevant world historical context” CANNOT count for the analysis point (#5).

2009 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2—Continuity/Change over Time 

Overview 

Students were asked to analyze the continuities and changes in patterns of interactions along the Silk 
Roads from 200 B.C.E. to 1450 C.E. They had five tasks: 1) to write an acceptable thesis that correctly 
specified both continuity and change; 2) to address both continuity and change, although not evenly or 
thoroughly; 3) to substantiate their thesis with appropriate historical evidence; 4) to use world historical 
context to effectively explain continuity and change over time; and 5) to analyze the process of continuity 
and change over time. Although students were not required to address “the patterns,” they did have to 
address interactions. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The thesis is in the first paragraph and addresses both continuity and change with specificity (1 point).  
A pattern of change (the rise and fall of empires) is explained on the first page in the third paragraph, and 
a pattern of continuity in trade is discussed on the first page in the fourth paragraph, (”The trade patterns 
were much the same as in previous years”) (2 points). The student provides abundant and historically 
accurate evidence for both continuity and change throughout the essay (2 points). The discussion of the 
Roman Empire and the Han dynasty dominating their regions, on the first page in the second paragraph, 
incorporates relevant world historical context (1 point). The student analyzes the process of change in a 
discussion of the effects of the adoption of paper money in the first paragraph on the second page  
(1 point). The student earned 1 expanded core point for a solid understanding of historical chronology, 
patterns, and cause and effect; sophisticated analysis; effective use of historically relevant examples; and a 
sound understanding of world historical context. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The essay’s attempted thesis, located in the first paragraph, does not address continuity and change with 
any historical specificity. A pattern of change is addressed in the third paragraph (“However, a major 
source of cultural diffusion—invasions and war—was not really apparent on the Silk Road in any large 
scale until the rise of the Mongols”) and a pattern of continuity in the second paragraph (“Another major 
item that the Silk Road continually spread was religion”) (2 points). There are four accurate pieces of 
evidence for change, but there is no accurate evidence for continuity (1 point). The essay includes a 
discussion of world historical context in explaining a change in the third paragraph, second and third 
sentences (1 point). The essay does not analyze the process of change or continuity over time using 
specific information that is different from the discussion of world historical context.  

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

There is no thesis in the introduction or in the conclusion. The essay addresses change in the first 
paragraph (1 point) but does not address continuity. The student does not include enough accurate 
evidence of change or continuity to earn a point. Additionally, there is no world historical context or 
analysis of the process of change or continuity.
