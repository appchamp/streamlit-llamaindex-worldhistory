2013 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

This question asked students to analyze how political transformations contributed to changes and 
continuities in the cultures of the Mediterranean region during the period circa 200 C.E. to circa 1000 C.E. 
Students were expected to provide historical evidence to support a discussion of change and continuity as 
impacted by political transformations in the Mediterranean within the time period. Further, students were 
to analyze world historical context by identifying regions outside the Mediterranean that shaped political 
transformations that contributed to cultural change and continuity. The AP World History course is 
designed to support student learning of four key historical thinking skills, one of which is “the ability to 
recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and change over periods of time of 
varying length, as well as relating these patterns to larger historical processes or themes.” Additionally, AP 
World History is anchored by five course themes. Although this question aligns with many of them, it is 
explicitly aligned with Theme 2: Development and Interaction of Cultures and Theme 3: State-Building, 
Expansion, and Conflict. The question provided an opportunity for students to demonstrate both an 
understanding of historical content and the application of historical thinking skills. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The thesis addresses how specific political transformations contributed to specified cultural change and 
continuity (1 point). The student addresses political transformations that contributed to cultural change and 
continuity (2 points). Fifteen pieces of evidence support political transformation, cultural change, or cultural 
continuity (2 points). Discussion of Germanic invasions earned world historical context credit (1 point). The 
student analyzes change and continuity in two places (1 point). An additional point (1 point) was awarded for 
addressing change and continuity twice each, two instances of analysis, and extensive evidence. The 
relatively weak thesis prevented the essay from gaining an additional score point. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The thesis does not adequately specify political transformation or discuss continuity. Although the student 
addresses political transformations contributing to cultural change four times (1 point), no continuity is 
addressed. Eleven pieces of evidence support discussion of political transformation, cultural change, or 
cultural continuity (2 points). Two examples of analysis explain the contribution of political transformations 
to change (1 point). The student does not provide world historical context for political transformations 
contributing to cultural change or continuity. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The thesis lacks overall specificity. The student addresses political transformations that contributed to 
cultural change (1 point) but fails to address continuity. Five pieces of evidence support discussion of 
political transformation and cultural change (1 point). The student does not provide analysis or world 
historical context.
