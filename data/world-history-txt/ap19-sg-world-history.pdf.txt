Short Answer Question 1 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt 
on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had 
an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their 
primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of 
numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange. 

Indeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian 
exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed at 
center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have seen, 
pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and West [in 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].” 

Thomas Allsen, historian, Culture and Conquest, 2001 

Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press. 

a) Identify ONE specific historical example of a cultural exchange between nomads and non-nomads that 
occurred in the period before 1450. 

b) For the period 1450–1750 C.E., identify ONE development that changed the role that Central Asian nomads 
played in cross-regional exchanges as described in the passage. 

c) Explain ONE cross-cultural exchange that would challenge the assertion in the last sentence of the passage 
concerning the nomads’ role in cross-regional exchanges before 1450.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying one specific historical example of a cultural exchange between nomads and 

non-nomads that occurred in the period before 1450 

•  ONE point for identifying one development in the period 1450–1750 C.E. that changed the role that 

Central Asian nomads played in cross-regional exchanges as described in the passage 

•  ONE point for explaining one cross-cultural exchange that would challenge the assertion in the last 
sentence of the passage concerning the nomads’ role in cross-regional exchanges before 1450 

Scoring Notes 

General notes to raters: 

•  Students are responding to the question with a variety of examples of nomadic peoples and cultural 

exchanges and interactions between nomadic and non-nomadic peoples that may or may not appear in 
college or high school textbooks. We encourage all raters to use any materials necessary to verify the 
accuracy of any such examples before scoring the response. 

•  We ask that you use a broad interpretation of “nomad” to include groups such as the Mongols that 
were nomadic but created empires and used the institutions and traditions of sedentary societies to 
govern their empires. This interpretation also pertains to groups such as the Arabs, which included 
both nomadic and sedentary peoples and also included nomads who eventually settled down and 
became sedentary. 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  Cultural exchanges between nomads and non-nomads included the spread of stirrups and gunpowder. 
•  Contact with nomadic peoples led the Song dynasty of China to use warhorses from Central Asia. 
•  The spread of religions such as Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, or Zoroastrianism across Central Asia 

in the period before 1450 was facilitated by contact between nomadic and non-nomadic societies along 
the Silk Roads. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  The decline of the importance of the Silk Roads changed the role of Central Asian nomads. 
•  The expansion of gunpowder empires, such as Russia and the Qing dynasty, led to the declining 

importance of Central Asian nomads in facilitating cross-regional exchange. 

•  European settlement of the Americas led to the declining importance of Central Asian nomads in cross-
regional exchanges because trans-Atlantic contact became more important to global economic and 
cultural exchange. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Christianity was mostly spread by merchants and missionaries who came from sedentary societies. 
•  The spread of technologies like the compass or papermaking would challenge Allsen’s claim that 
nomads were the chief promoters and agents of cultural exchange in Eurasia before 1450 because 
papermaking spread from China. 

•  Greek culture, philosophy, and science greatly influenced the development of Roman society, which 
challenges Allsen’s argument that nomads were the chief agents of cultural exchange in the period 
before 1450.

Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying one way that the data in the chart illustrate global economic differences 

between countries in the late twentieth century 

•  ONE point for identifying one similarity (other than GDP per capita) that might account for the low life 

expectancies of some of the world’s countries, as displayed in the chart 

•  ONE point for explaining one way in which longer life expectancies in some of the world’s countries, 

as displayed in the chart, have led to new political, economic, or social problems 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  The data show that the United States has a higher GDP than Swaziland. 
•  The chart shows that developed countries have higher life expectancies than underdeveloped 

countries. 

•  The chart shows that people in developed economies in the West and Asia live longer than people in 

underdeveloped countries because they have better access to modern medicine and vaccines. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  Poor water and food quality contribute to the low life expectancies in some of the countries shown in 

the chart. 

•  Formerly colonized countries shown in the chart might find it difficult to improve sanitation 

infrastructure and medical care because of economic imperialism. 

•  The lack of access to quality medical care and vaccines is a reason for the low life expectancies in 

some of the countries shown in the chart, particularly with the emergence of epidemic diseases such as 
AIDS and malaria. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Countries with long life expectancies have people who are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, 

which strains the healthcare system. 

•  Longer life expectancies in the countries shown in the chart have led to an increased economic burden 

• 

on a decreasing population of working-age citizens, creating social and political tensions. 
In Western European countries such as Norway and the United Kingdom, longer life-expectancy rates 
have created political controversy as a result of those governments’ commitment to social welfare 
programs.

Short Answer Question 3 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  After the Neolithic Revolution people began to practice agriculture. 
•  Some Eurasian societies began to practice nomadic pastoralism following the Neolithic Revolution. 
•  The Neolithic Revolution provided Eurasian societies with better tools with which to cultivate the land, 

harvest crops, and hunt. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Eurasian social structures changed in the Neolithic era as social hierarchies became more complex or 

patriarchal because of agriculture. 

•  The development of agriculture in Eurasia led to the creation of states, public works, or law codes 

because agriculture allowed societies to acquire surpluses that needed to be managed and protected. 

•  The emergence of agriculture following the Neolithic Revolution led to great increases in human 

populations because people could stay in one place, generate surpluses, and create more complex 
hierarchies based on social class or political power.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence from the Documents: 
Uses the content of at least three 
documents to address the topic of the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn 1 point, the response must accurately describe — 
rather than simply quote — the content from at least three 
of the documents to address the topic of how the 
Portuguese affected maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in 
the sixteenth century. 

OR   

Example:  

Supports an argument in response to 
the prompt using at least six 
documents. (2 points) 

•  

 (Document  3): “  The  anonymous  Portuguese court  
official  is arguing  that Portugal  should  do all  it  
can  to prevent  Turkish merchants  from  
establishing  direct  trade between India  and  the 
Ottoman  Empire.” (Describes  the  document  
accurately,  and thus  is credited  as  addressing  the  
topic,  but does not explicitly  tie  the  description  to  an  
argument in response  to  the  prompt.)  

OR 

To earn 2 points, the response must accurately describe 
—rather than simply quote — the content from at least six 
documents. In addition, the response must use the content 
from the documents to support an argument in response to 
the prompt. 

Example:  

•  

(Document  6):  “The Venetian trader  Cesare  
Federici’s account  shows  how  in Cambay the  
Portuguese are almost  completely  dependent  on  
their  Hindu  brokers to  carry  out  their  trade,  
showing  that  the  Portuguese  adapted  to  existing  
Indian  Ocean  trade.”  (Accurately  describes and 
connects  the content  of  the  document to  an 
argument about how  the  Portuguese  transformed 
maritime  trade  in  the  Indian Ocean  in the  sixteenth  
century.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence beyond the Documents: 
Uses at least one  additional  piece  of 
specific  historical  evidence (beyond  that  
found  in  the documents)  relevant  to  an 
argument  about  the prompt.  (1  point)  

To  earn this  point,  the  evidence  must  be  
described,  and must  be  more  than a 
phrase  or reference.  This  additional  piece  
of  evidence  must  be  different from  the  
evidence  used  to  earn  the  point  for 
contextualization.  

Typically,  statements  credited a  s  evidence from outside 
the documents  will  be more  specific  details  relevant  to  an 
argument,  analogous to  the  function of  evidence  drawn 
from the documents.  Typically,  statements  credited as  
contextualization  will  be  more  general  statements that  
place  an  argument  or a significant portion of  it on a  
broader  context.   

Note: The  specific  outside  evidence  must  be  clearly  
relevant to  the  expansion  of,  or  limits to,  Portuguese 
influence  in the  Indian Ocean.  

Examples could  include  the  following,  with  appropriate  
elaboration:  

•   Portuguese advances in  navigational  technology,  
such  as  the  development  of  caravels and  carracks  

•   Ottoman–Christian  wars and  rivalries in  the  
Mediterranean,  such  as the  battle  of Lepanto  

•   Safavid  empire as  another  regional  power  

checking  the expansion of  Portugal  in the Indian 
Ocean  

•   Political  fragmentation  of India  as Delhi 

sultanates fail  

Sourcing: For at least three documents, 
explains how or why the document’s 
point of view, purpose, historical 
situation, and/or audience is relevant to 
an argument. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the response must explain — rather 
than simply identify — how or why the document’s point 
of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for 
each of the three documents sourced.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of

multiple  factors  or by considering  diverse  or  
alternative  perspectives  or  evidence, such  as  
constructing  an argument that explains how  the  
Portuguese  both  disrupted  existing  trade  patterns 
and connections  in the  Indian Ocean,  but  also  
provided  Indian merchants  and  manufacturers  
with  new  business  opportunities,  such  as new  
trading  partnerships  and  new  export  markets  

•  Explaining  relevant and  insightful  connections

Document 

Summary of Content 

1. Muslim 
merchants 
advice to the 
ruler of Calicut, 
(1500) 

•   Expresses  Muslim  merchants’  
opposition  to  the Hindu  ruler  
of  Calicut  welcoming  the  
Portuguese  and  warns  the  
ruler  to  be cautious  

2. Duarte 
Barbosa, 
account of 
Calicut (1516) 

•   Describes  past wealth and  
independence of  Muslim  
merchants  in Calicut  but  
states that most of the  
Muslim  merchants have  left  

Explains the relevance of point of view, 
purpose, situation, and/or audience by 
elaborating on examples such as: 
•   Written  50  years after  the  events,  

Portugal  has consolidated  its presence  
in the region and  the Portuguese  
historian  is recording  the  spread  of 
Portuguese  power  (situation).  
•   Written  by Muslim  merchants 

concerned  that  the  Portuguese will  
become  their  political and  economic  
rivals  (POV).  

•   Portuguese government  official  on the 
Malabar  coast  likely  would  have  
wanted  to emphasize  positive  effects  
of the  Portuguese  establishing  trading  
posts  (POV/purpose).  

•   Written  in  the  very early years of the  

Portuguese establishing  a  presence in 
India,  the  account  seeks to  emphasize  
the Portuguese achievement  of  already  
displacing  the  Muslims  (situation).  

3. Anonymous 
Portuguese court 
official’s advice 
to King 
Sebastian (mid-
1560s) 

4. Sultan 
Alauddin of 
Aceh, letter to 
the Ottoman 
sultan (1566) 

•   Cautions king  against free  

•   The  Ottoman  Empire’s  westward  

trade  treaty  with the  Ottoman  
Empire  due  to  competition  
from  Ottoman  merchants  

expansion  has brought it into conflict 
with  several  Western European  
countries,  including  Portugal,  over  
control  of  Mediterranean  and  Indian  
Ocean  trade  (situation).  

•   As  private  advice  offered  to  the  king  of  
Portugal by  a  high-level  government  
official,  the  letter  offers a  frank 
analysis  of  the  dangers Ottomans  pose  
to  Portugal’s  spice  monopoly  and the  
many  advantages Ottoman  merchants 
would  enjoy  if  allowed  to  compete 
freely  (audience/purpose).  

•   Describes  Portuguese threat

merchants  and  requests  
Ottoman  help  in defense  

•   An address  to  a  fellow  Muslim  ruler;  
uses  Islamic  rhetoric  and  appeals  to  
shared Muslim values  (audience).  
•   The  Ottoman  Empire’s  success  in  

fighting  against  European  powers has 
boosted  its  military prestige  and  other  
Muslim  rulers are  asking  the  Ottomans 
for  military assistance  (situation).

of  safe  conduct  passes,  
opposing  it but also noting  it 
has  been accepted by 
 Calicut  
merchants  

•   A  religious  scholar,  perhaps wishing

6. Cesare 
Federici, The 
Voyage and 
Travel to East 
India (1587) 

•   Describes  local-agent  broker 
system  for  trade  in  Cambay,  
as  well as  the  low-price  and  
low-quality  pepper  exchange 
at  Cochin  

7. Inlaid box 
made in Gujarat 
for export to 
Portugal (circa 
1600) 

•   Shows  a  box  inlaid  with ivory 
and  precious  hardwoods,  
decorated  with  a  hunting  
scene  

efforts to implement the  safe  passage  
pass (cartaz) in  South  Asia  (situation)  

•   As  Venetians  were generally  rivals  of  
the  Portuguese  in  trade,  Federici may  
have  intended  this account to  point to  
the  limitations of  the  commercial  
power and  reach  of  the  Portuguese  in  
India (  POV/purpose).  

•   As Federici’s  account was  published  in  

Venice and  likely  intended  for  a  
Venetian  merchant audience,  it may  
have  emphasized  the  potential  
commercial  opportunities in  India
for  
example,  by  suggesting  that  only  low-
, 
quality pepper  is  being  sold  to  the  
Portuguese,  while  the  high-quality  
pepper  remains  available for  purchase 
in India  (audience).  

•   As an 

 object  made  specifically  for  

export to Portugal,  the  box  illustrates 
how  important  Portuguese (  and  
therefore European)  markets  had  
become to  some Indian craftspeople 
(situation).   

•   As  a  precious  and  likely  very  

expensive  object,  the box shows  the 
increased  luxury  goods  consumption  
of  European elites,  who  had  enough  
economic  resources  not  only to buy 
such  items but also  to  influence  to  
their  design  and  artistic  style  
(audience).

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student 

could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of this rubric require that students demonstrate historically defensible 

content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract 
from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Student samples (when available) are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim  (0-1  point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian 
Ocean in the sixteenth century and indicate some reason for taking that position. 

Examples of acceptable theses: 

• 

• 

• 

“Although the arrival of the Portuguese was a very important change in Indian Ocean maritime trade in 
the sixteenth century, it did not completely transform the trade, as the Portuguese never extended their 
control beyond a few ports and had to compete with Indian merchants and regional states such as the 
Ottoman Empire and the Sultanate of Aceh.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that 
establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“The Portuguese brought a few changes to the Indian Ocean trading networks but most Indian goods, 
including spices, continued to be traded locally, or to Middle Eastern and Chinese markets, as they had 
been for centuries before.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 
“The Portuguese transformed maritime trade in Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century by taxing non-
Portuguese ships that traded in the region.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim 
that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Example of unacceptable theses: 

• 

• 

• 

“In the sixteenth century, the arrival of the Portuguese completely transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean region.” (Merely repeats the wording of the prompt with a minor qualification, which does 
not amount to indicating a line of reasoning.) 
“Portuguese merchants came to dominate Indian Ocean trade by organizing themselves into powerful 
joint-stock companies.” (Not a historically defensible claim.) 
“Despite its small size and population, Portugal used its location on the Atlantic Ocean to transform 
itself into a major maritime power” (Does not respond to the prompt directly.) 

B.  Contextualization  (0-1  point)  

Responses earn 1 point for contextualization by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. 
To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, 
or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not 
awarded for merely a phrase or reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to Portuguese impact and/or maritime 
trade in the Indian Ocean in the period before or during the arrival of the Portuguese. 

Examples of acceptable contextualization: 

• 

• 

“For centuries before the arrival of European merchants, the Indian Ocean had been the center of 
flourishing trade routes connecting India to East and Southeast Asia as well as with East Africa, Egypt, 
and Arabia.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 
“Portugal’s naval advances such as stronger ships allowed the Portuguese to engage in transoceanic 
trade.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization: 

• 

• 

“The Indian Ocean sea trade before 1500 has been described as a maritime equivalent of the overland 
Silk Roads.” (While potentially relevant, this statement does not sufficiently describe how this context was 
relevant to Portuguese maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 
“Portugal’s naval advances made it a major player in European political rivalries. (While potentially 
relevant, this statement does not sufficiently describe how this context was relevant to Portuguese maritime 
trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 

C.  Evidence  (0-3  points)  

a) Document  Content  —  Addressing  the  Topic  (1  point)  

In order to achieve the first point, the response must use the content of at least three documents to address the 
topic of the prompt (1 point). To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately 
describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Examples of describing the content of a document: 

• 

• 

(Document 3): “The anonymous Portuguese court official is arguing that Portugal should do all it can 
to prevent Turkish merchants from establishing direct trade between India and the Ottoman Empire.” 
(Describes the document accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie 
the description to an argument in response to the prompt.) 
(Document 4): “The letter by the ruler of Aceh asks the Ottoman sultan for help against the attacks of 
the Portuguese.” (Describes the document accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but 
does not explicitly tie the description to an argument in response to the prompt.) 

b)  Document  Content  –  Supporting  an Argument  (1  point)  

In order to achieve the second point for evidence from the documents, the response needs to support an 
argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least six documents. 

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 

• 

• 

(Document 4): “The ruler of Aceh, Alauddin al Kahar, wrote to the Ottoman sultan complaining of the 
devastating impact the Portuguese had on the long distance trade from ‘all the ports of Indonesia,’ as 
well as on the pilgrimage from Aceh to Mecca. Alauddin’s letter describes the Portuguese wreaking 
havoc on Acehnese ships by intercepting them in the ocean, attacking and sinking them, or capturing 
and enslaving the passengers. This shows how long-established trade routes were completely 
disrupted by the Portuguese.” (Accurately describes and connects the content of the document to an 
argument about the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the 
sixteenth century.) 
(Document 6): “The Venetian trader Cesare Federici’s account shows how in Cambay the Portuguese 
are almost completely dependent on their Hindu brokers to carry out their trade, showing that the 
Portuguese adapted to existing Indian Ocean trade.” (Accurately describes and connects the content of 
the document to an argument about the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 

c)  Evidence  beyond  the Documents  (1  point)  

The response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the 
documents) relevant to an argument that addresses how the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century (1 point). To earn this point, the evidence must be described, and it must 
be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence used 
to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn 
from the documents.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond the documents 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt: 

• 

• 

“Much like the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire of Iran was a major Muslim state whose power 
served as a check to Portuguese expansion in the Indian Ocean region.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt.) 
“Although spices remained the main commodity drawing Portuguese merchants to India, Indian cotton 
textiles were also imported and became increasingly popular in Europe.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt.) 

D.  Analysis  and  Reasoning  (2  points)  

Document Sourcing (0-1 point) 

For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, 
historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt (1 point). To earn 
this point, the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of 
view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of 
the three documents sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 

•  

(Document 2): “Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese official stationed at a trading post on the Malabar coast, 
described the great wealth and independence from political authority that Muslim traders in Calicut 
had enjoyed before the arrival of the Portuguese. Barbosa states that Muslims would have taken over 
the whole Malabar coast ‘if the king of Portugal had not discovered India’ and ‘made himself master 
there,’ a statement that demonstrates how the as a Portuguese government official he is biased against 
Muslims and is willing to trumpet Portuguese achievements. (Provides sourcing regarding the point of 
view of the document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 

•  

(Document 1): “Since the Muslim merchants of Calicut were desperately trying to convince the Hindu 
ruler of Calicut to act against the Portuguese, they used a much more direct language than one would 
expect to see in an address by subjects to their king. For example, they state that the ruler is 
dishonoring himself by his actions and is emboldening the Portuguese to hold him in contempt.” 
(Provides sourcing regarding the purpose of document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: 

•  

(Document 7): “The fact that Gujarati artists and craftsmen were showing figures wearing European 
attire in their decorative scenes shows how important maritime trade between Portugal and India had 
become for both countries.” (Provides sourcing regarding the situation in which this trade good was 
produced relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: 

•  

(Document 4): “The letter by the ruler of Aceh, being an appeal to a fellow Muslim ruler, repeatedly 
flatters the Ottoman sultan, calls the Portuguese “infidels,” and emphasizes the danger they pose to the 
Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.” (Provides sourcing regarding the audience of the letter relevant to an 
argument addressing the prompt.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding (0-1 point) 

The response demonstrates a complex understanding of how the Portuguese affected Indian Ocean maritime 
trade in the sixteenth century, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the 
question. 

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Considering the totality of the evidence and perspectives presented in the documents as demonstrated 
by creating a complex argument, while at the same time recognizing that some documents corroborate, 
qualify, or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that explains how the Portuguese both 
disrupted existing trade patterns and connections in the Indian Ocean, but also provided Indian 
merchants and manufacturers with new business opportunities, such as new trading partnerships and 
new export markets 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining similarities 

or differences in the pattern of sixteenth-century Portuguese imperialism in the Indian Ocean 
compared to other locations such as Brazil, West Africa, Japan, China, or the spice islands of 
Southeast Asia 

This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., the rise of large-scale empires led to increasing regional and transregional 
trade. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in this time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Scoring Note: Essays may discuss increases in any type of trade, including regional and local trade. 

Points  Rubric 

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning. (1 point) 

To  earn  this  point,  the  thesis  must  make  
a  claim  that  responds  to  the  prompt,  
rather  than  merely  restating  or  rephrasing  
the  prompt.  The  thesis  must  consist  of  
one  or  more  sentences  located  in  one  
place,  either  in  the  introduction  or  the  
conclusion.   

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which the rise of 
one or more empires contributed to an increase in trade 
in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., with some 
indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The  thesis  is  not  required  to  encompass  the  entire  period,  
but  must  identify  a  relevant  development  or  developments  
in  the  period.  

Examples:  
●   “In  the  period  600  B.C.E.  to  600  C.E.  rising  empires  
encouraged  an  increase  in  trade  both  within  and  
across  world  regions  in  a  variety  of  ways  such  as  by  
providing  peace  and  security,  developing  roads  and  
markets,  and  issuing  currencies.”  (Responds  to  the  
prompt  with  an  evaluative  claim  that  establishes  a  line  
of  reasoning.)  

●   “Empires  in  this  period  increased  trade  by  providing  
security  across  their  territories.”  (Responds  to  the  
prompt  with  a  minimally  acceptable  claim  that  
establishes  a  line  of  reasoning.)   

Contextualization:  Describes  a  broader  
historical  context  relevant  to  the  
prompt.  (1  point)  

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the rise of one or more empires 
and/or increasing trade in the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 
600 C.E. 

To earn this point, the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

Example:  
●   “In  the  period  600  B.C.E.-600  C.E.,  the  rulers  of  many  
empires  created  more  complex  governments,  raised  
larger  armies,  and  some  empires  used  new  religions  
developing  in  this  period  to  bolster  their  power.”  
(Relates  broader  events  and  developments  to  the  
topic.)

● 

Examples  (acceptable):   
●   “The  Persians  used  some  of  the  first  minted  coins.”  
(Counts  toward  earning  the  point  because  there  is  a

“Parthia’s location contributed to the growth of 
trade in spices.” (Counts toward earning the point 
because there is a specific historical example relevant 
to the prompt.) 
“The network of paved roads in the Roman Empire 
helped increase trade in the empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

● 

●  “The Qin and Han dynasties in China helped expand 
trade by standardizing weights and measures, and 
appointing market inspectors.” (Counts toward 
earning the point because there is a specific historical 
example relevant to the prompt.) 

Examples (unacceptable): 
●  “The paving of trade roads led to the growth of 

trading practices.” (Does not count toward earning the 
point because the information provided is not specific 
to a time and place.) 

●  “During the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. rising 

imperial states contributed to the growth of both 
regional and transregional trade, as people 
exchanged more goods.” (Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific 
information beyond what is provided in the 
introductory statement.)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

OR  

OR  

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence. (2 points) 

To  earn  the  second  point,  the  response  must  use  at  least  
two  specific  historical  examples  to  support  an  argument  
in  response  to  the  prompt.  

If  a  response  has  a  multipart  argument  (e.g.,  the  
expansion  of  some  empires  increased  trade  while  the  
expansion  of  other  empires  disrupted  trade),  then  the  
response  can  earn  the  second  evidence  point  by  using  only  
one  specific  historical  example  for  each  part  of  the  
multipart  argument  (but  the  total  number  of  examples  
used  must  still  be  at  least  two).  

Evidence  used  to  support  an  argument  might  include:   
●   The  Royal  Road  in  the  Persian  Empire  shortened  
travel  times  and  stimulated  trade  between  the  
capital  and  the  provinces.  

●   The  Hellenistic  empires  greatly  expanded  trade  in  
the  Eastern  Mediterranean  because  of  the  common  
language  and  culture.  

●   The  Han  Dynasty  used  the  Silk  Road  to  export  

luxury  goods  to  distant  locations.  

●   The  Roman  Empire  developed  a  system  of  state  

sponsored  purchases  of  grain  from  Egypt  in  order  
to  feed  the  growing  population  of  Rome.

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (1 point) 

To  earn  the  first  point,  the  response  must  
demonstrate  the  use  of  historical  
reasoning  to  frame  or  structure  an  
argument  about  the  extent  to  which  the  
rise  of  one  or  more  empires  contributed  to  
an  increase  in  trade  in  the  period  from  
600  B.C.E.  to  600  C.E.  

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain the extent 
to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.

OR 

OR 

Complexity:  Demonstrates  a  complex  
understanding  of  the  historical  
development  that  is  the  focus  of  
prompt,  using  evidence  to  corroborate,  
qualify,  or  modify  an  argument  that  
addresses  the  prompt.  (2  points)  

To earn the second point, the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the extent to which the 
rise of one more empires contributed to 
an increase in trade in the period from 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Demonstrating  complex  understanding  might  include:  
●   Explaining  the  nuance  of  an  issue  by  analyzing  
multiple  variables  or  by  considering  diverse  or  
alternative  perspectives  or  evidence,  such  as  
constructing  an  argument  about  how  trade  
expansion  in  this  period  was  mostly  accomplished  
by  nonimperial  actors,  such  as  commercial  city-
states  (as  in  Phoenicia  and  Greece)  or  merchant  
groups  (such  as  Sogdians  or  diaspora  Jews)  
●   Qualifying  or  modifying  the  main  argument  of  the  
essay  to  demonstrate  awareness  of  historical  
complexity,  such  as  constructing  an  argument  that  
the  rise  of  empires  generally  expanded  trade,  but  in  
other  cases  limited  trade  either  by  disrupting  
existing  trade  networks  (for  example,  Alexander’s  
conquests  led  to  an  economic  and  commercial  
decline  of  the  core  Persian  territories)  or  by  empires  
implementing  policies  to  limit  the  power  of  
merchants  (for  example,  the  Han  Dynasty  imposing  
heavy  taxes  on  merchants  and  limiting  their  ability  
to  own  land)  

●   Explaining  relevant  and  insightful  connections  

across  time  and  space,  such  as  explaining  how  the  
rise  of  empires  in  Eurasia  contributed  both  to  the  
increased  trade  in  the  so-called  First  Silk  Roads  
period  (from  circa  50  B.C.E.  to  circa  200  C.E.)  and  to  
the  revival  of  that  trade  in  the  so-called  Second  Silk  
Roads  period  (from  circa  700  to  circa  1200  C.E.)  

This demonstration of complex understanding must be 
part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference. 

If response is completely blank, enter - - for all four score categories: A, B, C, and D.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A.  Thesis/Claim  (0–1  point)   

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Scoring Note: Essays may discuss increases in any type of trade, including regional and local trade. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

•  

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. rising empires encouraged the increase in trade both within and 
across world regions in a variety of ways such as by providing peace and security, developing roads 
and markets, and issuing currencies.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes 
a line of reasoning.) 
“Although the rise of large-scale empires certainly contributed to expanding trade in the period 600 
B.C.E.–600 C.E., it was only one of several factors in doing so, other factors being population growth, the 
growth of cities, and improved technological and environmental knowledge.” (Responds to the prompt 
with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“Empires in this period increased trade by providing security across their territories.” (Responds to the 
prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

•   From 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.  many large empires developed and led to increasing regional and 

• 

• 

transregional commercial connections. (Offers a historically defensible claim, but it includes no additional 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Most empires in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.  depended on long-distance transregional trade for 
the daily needs of their growing populations.” (Not a historically defensible claim.) 
“Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire and spread Greek culture in the period from 600 
B.C.E. to 600 C.E.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference a specific factor relevant to 
how imperial expansion affected the growth of trade.) 

•  The Roman Empire went through a long period of peace, called the Pax Romana. (Potentially relevant 

but has no clear link to trade.) 

B.  Contextualization  (0–1  point)  

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. This point is not awarded 
for merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the rise of one or more empires 
and/or increasing trade in the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

•  

“In the period 600 B.C.E.-600 C.E., the rulers of many empires created more complex governments, 
raised larger armies, and used some of the new religions developing in this period to bolster their 
power.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

•  

•  

“The period from around 600 B.C.E. to around 600 C.E. is sometimes referred to as the “Axial Age.” 
(Potentially relevant but is merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe.”) 
“In India, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka completed the conquest of Kalinga and then focused on 
spreading and promoting Buddhism.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to increases in trade.) 

C.  Evidence  (0–2  points)  

Evidence  

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of whether the rise of 
empires led to increases in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. These examples of evidence must be 
different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“The network of paved roads in the Roman Empire helped increase trade in the empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“During the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., rising imperial states contributed to the growth of both 
regional and transregional trade, as people exchanged more goods.” (Does not count toward earning the 
point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement.) 

OR 

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an increase in trade 
in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“Empires often led to an expansion trade within their boundaries simply by establishing and maintaining 
peace and the rule of law over large areas. In the Roman Empire in the first and second century C.E., the 
Pax Romana was a long period of prosperity and booming trade. In China, after the upheavals of the 
short-lived Qin Dynasty, the Han Dynasty established a period of peace and public order that lasted 
several centuries, also leading to an expansion of trade.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in 
accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt.) 

D.  Analysis  and  Reasoning  (0–2  points)  

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which the rise of one or more empires led to an increase in trade from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. To earn this 
point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, 
although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

• 

• 
• 

Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation contributed to the geographic expansion of trade 
networks 
Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation led to growing demand for trade goods 
Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation led to the drawing of new peoples into commercial 
networks

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which 
technological innovations or transfers led to increased 
economic growth in the period 600 to 1450 C.E., with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis is not  required  to encompass  the entire period, 
but it must  identify  a  relevant  development  or  
developments  in  the  period.

as  technologies.  

Example (acceptable):  
•  

“One innovation that  encouraged  economic  growth  
during  this period  was  the  practice  of  merchants  
carrying  letters of credit instead  of cash.”  (Counts  
  specific

historical  example relevant  to the prompt.)  

Example (unacceptable): 
•  

“During  the period  600-1450  C.E.,  economic  growth 
occurred  because of  the expansion of  trade  
networks and  the  rise  in  economic  productive  
capacity.”  (Does not count  toward earning  the  point 
because there  is  no  specific  information  beyond  what  
is  provided in  the  introductory  statement.)  

OR 

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument 
in response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., technological 
innovations treated separately from technological 
transfers), then the response can earn the second evidence 
point by using only one specific historical example for 
each part of the multipart argument (but the total number 
of examples used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  

Innovations in  navigational  technology  (compass, 
astrolabe,  lateen  sail,  stern-post  rudder,  etc.)  helped  
significantly increase  the  volume  and  extent of 
trade in the Mediterranean and  the  Indian Ocean.  
•   New  crops (  such  as Champa rice  in  China) greatly  
boosted  agricultural  productivity in some regions  
and  led  to considerable  economic  growth.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A.  Thesis/Claim  (0–1  point)   

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased 
economic growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Scoring Note: Student responses may discuss advances in agricultural, commercial, or financial practices under the 
rubric of “technological innovations.” 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“In the period 600-1450 C.E., the Abbasid Caliphs promotion of science and trade led economic growth 
by expanding mathematical and geographic knowledge as well as by encouraging the development of 
new economic practices such as the use of camels and caravans.” (Responds to the prompt with an 
evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“In Europe, new commercial and financial practices developed during the late Middle Ages that greatly 
expanded the economy and prosperity some regions such as Renaissance Italy or the cities of the 
Hanseatic League” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“Trade in particular grew in the period because of the invention of tools such as the compass.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

• 

“Technological advances and transfers often contributed to increased economic growth in the period 
between 600 and 1450 C.E.” (Offers a historically defensible claim, but it includes no additional 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Technological innovations in the period 600-1450 C.E. completely transformed the agricultural 
economies of the previous period into commercial economies.” (Not a historically defensible claim.) 
“Between 600 and 1450 C.E., many important technologies spread from one Eurasian region to another 
via the Silk Roads.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference a specific technology or an 
effect on economic growth.) 
“During this period, great changes occurred because of the invention of the compass.” (Potentially 
relevant but has no clear link to trade or economic growth.) 

B.  Contextualization  (0–1  points)  

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame from 600 to 1450 C.E. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to technological innovations/transfers 
and increased economic growth in the period circa 600 to 1450 C.E. 

Examples of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The Crusades, for example, despite being a religious and political conflict, also made it possible for 
scientific knowledge and new technologies to be exchanged between the Muslim world of the eastern 
Mediterranean and the Christian world of western Europe.” (Relates broader events and developments to 
the topic.) 
“In Eurasia, the period 600 to 1450 was one of greatly increased connections between regions, caused 
in large part by the spread of religions.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The Crusades were one of the most significant historical developments during this period.” 
(Potentially relevant, but it is merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe,” nor does 
it provide a link to technology or economic growth.) 
“In Mesoamerica, the Maya developed highly sophisticated mathematical and astronomical knowledge 
to use in performing their religious ceremonies.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to technology 
or economic growth.)

C.  Evidence  (0–2  points)  

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of whether technological 
innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period circa 600 to 1450 C.E. These examples 
of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information. 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

“One innovation that encouraged economic growth during this period was the practice of merchants 
carrying letters of credit instead of cash.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

•

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

“During the period 600-1450 C.E., economic growth occurred because of the expansion of trade 
networks and the rise in economic productive capacity.” (Does not count toward earning the point 
because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement.) 

•

OR 

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased economic 
growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“Maritime trade was one area of increased economic growth that greatly benefitted from technological 
innovations and transfers in this period. In both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean economic 
growth received a boost from the increased volume of trade resulting from the expanded use of 
astrolabes, compasses, lateen sails (originally developed in the dhows of the Indian Ocean), stern-post 
rudders, and overall sturdier ship designs.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate support 
of an argument that addresses the prompt.)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

D.  Analysis  and  Reasoning  (0–2  points)  

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period from 600 to 
1450 C.E. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or 
structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining how technological innovations or transfers led directly to economic growth by making 

production of and/or trade in goods faster, cheaper, or more efficient 

•  Explaining how technological innovations or transfers led indirectly to economic growth by increasing 

demand for goods, freeing up labor supply, or concentrating producers and consumers in cities 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the extent to which technological 
innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. by using 
evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. 

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or 

alternative perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that discusses technology as one 
factor affecting economic growth in that period (among other factors such as political change, spread of 
religions, or environmental processes) 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that explains how technological innovations of transfers, 
which usually lead to increased economic growth, may, in some cases or circumstances, have negative 
or unintended economic consequences (for example, soil erosion and salinization in heavily cultivated

Question 4 — Long Essay Question 

“In the period after 1900, the role of the state in the economy varied, with many states adopting policies to 
control or manage their economies. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in this 
time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6

thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning. (1 point) 

 the  prompt,  

To  earn this  point,  the  thesis  must  make  
a claim  that responds to 
rather than  merely  restating  or rephrasing  
the prompt.  The thesis  must  consist  of  
one or  more sentences  located in one 
place,  either in the  introduction  or  the  
conclusion.   

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which one or more 
states controlled their economies in the period after 
1900, with some indication of the reasoning for making 
that claim. 

The thesis is not  required  to encompass  the entire period, 
but it must  identify  a  relevant  development  or  
developments  in  the  period.  
Examples:  
•

“The twentieth  century  included  several  examples  
of  states  controlling  their  economies,  the  most 
famous being  that of the  Soviet Union,  which  used  
Marxist ideology to

planning.” (Responds to 
evaluative  claim  that  establishes a  line  of  reasoning.)  
“In  recent  years,  many  countries  rejected  the idea  of  
trying  to control  their economies  and  embraced  free  
market capitalism.” (Responds  to  the  prompt  with a  
minimally  acceptable  claim  that  establishes a  line  of  
reasoning.)

Contextualization:  Describes  a  broader 
historical  context relevant to  the  
prompt.  (1 point)  

To earn  this point,  the  essay must accurately describe  a  
context  relevant  to  the  development of states and  
economic policy  in the period  after  1900.  

To earn this point, the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

Example:  
•  

“World War  I  upset  the  global political and  
economic  order  and  led  to  the establishment  of  new  
totalitarian  states.” (Relates broader events  and 
developments  to the topic.)

Example (unacceptable):

different  approaches  to economic  policy,  with some  
states attempting  to control  while  other  states

China exercised great control over their economies 
by collectivizing agriculture and Five-Year Plans. 

•  Fascist states (including Japan) in the interwar 
period developed corporatist economic policies 
where state officials and representatives of big 
business cooperated in guiding economic policy 
and setting production targets in some economic 
sectors, while preserving the basic structure of a 
capitalist economy.

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•   Partly in 

 response  to the  two  world  wars  and  the  

Great Depression,  many  Western  states also  
increased  their  level  of  intervention in the economy,  
by more  actively promoting  economic  development  
projects,  adopting  some  level  of economic  planning,  
and  launching  social  welfare  programs.  

•   Beginning  in the 1980s,  the growing  emphasis  on 
neoliberal,  free  market economic  policies led  some  
countries,  notably  the  United  States  and  Great  
Britain,  to return  to less interventionist economic  
policies.  

•   After  decolonization,  many  newly  independent  

states in  Asia,  Africa,  and  the  Americas pursued  
interventionist (sometimes socialist)  economic  
policies and  attempted  to  guide  their  countries’  
economic  development.  

Especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, 
international economic organizations such as the IMF 
and World Bank restricted some governments’ ability to 
control their economies by imposing Western economic 
practices. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain the extent 
to which one or more states controlled their economies in 
the period after 1900. 

Examples of  using  historical  reasoning  might include:  
•   Explaining  the role  of  ideologies  and  economic  
theories,  such as Marxism,  neoliberalism,  or  
Keynesian  economics,  in  informing  states’  
economic  policies  in the twentieth  century  
•   Explaining  the  role of  new technologies,  such  as  

mass  media  or  the Internet,  on  states’  ability  to  
control  or  direct  their  economies  

•   Explaining  the role  of  economic  cycles  in increasing  
or lowering  the  appeal  of  ideas  and  policies  of  
government  economic  regulations  

•   Explaining  the role  of  wars  and  wartime resource  
mobilization  on  governments’  ability and/or  
willingness  to  regulate the national  economy  

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (1 point) 

To  earn the  first point,  the  response  must  
demonstrate  the use of  historical  
reasoning  to  frame  or structure  an 
argument about the extent  to which  one 
or  more states  controlled their  economies  
in the period  after  1900.

economic  initiative  (as seen  in  the examples  of  the  
NEP and  perestroika policies in  the  Soviet  Union  or 
in  China  following  the  liberalization  policies of 
Deng  Xiaoping). Alternatively,  even  states that 
subscribe  to free  market economic  principles

boards  and  the  nationalization  of many pension  and  
medical  insurance schemes  in Western countries).

economic  policies  of  the  nineteenth  centuries

and  then partly  returned  to  favor  in  the late 
twentieth  century.   

This demonstration of complex understanding must be

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A.  Thesis/Claim  (0–1  point)   

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in the 
period after 1900. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period but must identify a relevant development or 
developments that originated in the period. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

“The twentieth century included several examples of states controlling their economies, the most 
famous being that of the Soviet Union, which used Marxist ideology to justify its nationalization of 
industry and introduction of centralized economic planning.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative 
claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 

•  While some states after 1900, such as communist Russia and China, exercised great control over their 
economies, the United States and many Western European believed in implementing more free-market 
policies. (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“In recent years, many countries rejected the idea of trying to control their economies and embraced 
free market capitalism.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line 
of reasoning.) 

• 

•  Communist countries fully regulated their economies. (Responds to the prompt with a minimally 

acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

• 

• 

In the period since 1900, many states have attempted to control their economies, to one extent or 
another.” (Offers a historically defensible claim but includes no additional information beyond what is 
provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Economic policy in the period after 1900 has been dominated by the debate over mercantilism versus 
free trade.” (Not a historically defensible claim.) 
“The global nature of financial markets and the emergence of multinational corporations in the late 
twentieth century led to staggering economic inequalities between the haves and the have-nots.” 
(Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference specific state economic policy relevant to 
economic control.) 
“The economies of Russia and China were communist.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does 
not reference specific state economic policy relevant to economic control.) 
“Many countries in this period fully controlled their economies.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt but 
does not reference a specific country or policy.) 

B.  Contextualization  (0–1  point)  

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame after 1900. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the development of states and 
economic policy in the period after 1900. 

Examples of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“As shown by the experiences of the 1800s, unregulated capitalism could lead to periodic economic 
crises and create persistent social problems having to do with poverty, crime, and urban sprawl. Many 
economists and politicians came to believe that some form of government economic regulation was 
needed to manage or prevent such problems.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 
“The Great Depression convinced many economists and politicians, as well as the general population 
of many countries, that the free market could not be relied upon to self-correct or always deliver 
economic prosperity.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“Hitler never forgot Germany’s harrowing experience with hyperinflation.” (Potentially relevant but is 
merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe.”) 

•  The carnage of World War I showed colonized people everywhere that Europe had lost the moral claim 

to be a world leader.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to economic policies or economic 
changes.)

C.  Evidence  (0–2  points)  

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the extent of states control of their 
economies in the period after 1900. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to 
earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information. 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward is one of the best examples of communist states controlling their 
economies.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt.) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“In the period after 1900, different states took different approaches to economic policy, with some 
states attempting to control while other states merely seeking to manage their national economies.” 
(Does not count toward earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided 
in the introductory statement.) 

OR 

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in the period after 
1900. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“In early-twentieth-century Japan, the state attempted to control the economy indirectly, by supporting 
and partnering with large private companies called zaibatsu which were given favorable tax rates and 
tariff protection in exchange for developing heavy industry, which the state needed for its military 
expansion. In Nazi Germany too, the government used indirect measures to control and direct the 
economy, The Nazis established close ties with leading German manufacturers and banks many of 
whom had lucrative government military contracts. In exchange for their cooperation, these companies 
and banks were given a free hand to deal with labor unions workers’ demands.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt.)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

D.  Analysis  and  Reasoning  (0–2  points)  

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which one or more states controlled their economies in the period after 1900. To earn this point, the 
response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the 
reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining the role of ideologies and economic theories, such as Marxism, neoliberalism, or Keynesian 

economics, in informing states’ economic policies in the twentieth century 

•  Explaining the role of new technologies, such as mass media or the Internet, on states’ ability to control 

or direct their economies 

•  Explaining the role of economic cycles in increasing or lowering the appeal of ideas and policies of 

government economic regulations 

•  Explaining the role of wars and wartime resource mobilization on governments’ ability and/or 

willingness to regulate the national economy 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the extent to which states controlled 
their economies in the period after 1900, by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the question. 

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or 

alternative perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that discusses how economic 
globalization and the increasingly international nature of economic production and consumption is 
diminishing the importance of the nation-state as an economic actor. 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that even states that attempted to control their economies 
completely sometimes relaxed their control and allowed some measure of private economic initiative (as 
seen in the examples of the NEP and perestroika policies in the Soviet Union or in China following the 
liberalization policies of Deng Xiaoping). Alternatively, even states that subscribe to free-market 
economic principles sometimes adopt aspects of economic control (as seen in the examples of various 
wartime planning boards and the nationalization of many pension and medical insurance schemes in 
Western countries). 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining why the 

economic policies of the nineteenth centuries became discredited in the early twentieth century and then 
partly returned to favor in the late twentieth century
