Question #1  

Task: Short Answer  
Question  

Topic:  von Laue on Westernization  
Secondary Text   

Max. Points: 3  

Mean Score: 1.20  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this question, students were expected to analyze a secondary source document by identifying a nationalist leader 
whose actions might be used to illustrate the author’s argument. Next, they were asked to explain one way the “world 
revolution of Westernization” disrupted non-Western societies. Lastly, the question prompted students to explain a 
reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western Imperialism. The question primarily addressed 
Topics 6.3, 7.1., and 8.1 of the AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question asked students to demonstrate their knowledge of the role of imperialism, Westernization, and nationalism 
in a global context. All three of these are tied directly to the course, and students were able to demonstrate their 
understanding of the topics, frequently citing nationalist leaders in South Asia and Africa and demonstrating an 
understanding of the ways in which Westernization disrupted non-Western countries through technological, political, 
social, and cultural influence. Students frequently were able to accurately identify the importance of Mohandas Gandhi, 
Ho Chi Minh, and Nelson Mandela as non-Western nationalist leaders whose actions supported von Laue’s argument. 
Students understood the causal relationship between Westernization, imperialism, and the disruption of traditional 
political and economic systems in many non-Western countries. 

While some students understood that historians were interested in reinterpreting Western imperialism because of the 
effects of decolonization or in order to reevaluate the legacy of Western rule, most student responses tended not to 
explain one reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western imperialism. They did not explain 
the role of decolonization, the Cold War, nor globalization and instead provided answers that did not address the 
question. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Some students identified European leaders for part (a). Whether this was simply because they were the only nationalist 
leaders they could think of or if they misunderstood the prompt is unclear. 

Students had difficulty with explaining how events or processes in the late twentieth century led historians to reinterpret 
Western imperialism. Many responses identified trends in the late twentieth century (“gender inequality” or “warfare”) 
without connecting those trends to reinterpretations of imperialism in the way the passage from von Laue discusses it.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

•  

“One non-Western nationalist leader 
whose actions might be used to 
illustrate the author’s argument in the 
passage is Karl Marx.” (Karl Marx 
was not a non-Western nationalist 
leader.) 

“One reason why historians 
reinterpreted western imperialism 
was because of the world wars. 
During and after the world wars, lots 
of things changed like gender roles or 
types of government.” (The allusions 
to the world wars and gender roles do 
not expain why historians would have 
reinterpreted Western imperialism.) 

•  

•  

“A non-Western nationalist leader who 
supports the author’s argument is Mahatma 
Gandhi. Gandhi was a well-known figure who 
led peaceful demonstrations and protests 
against British rule.” (The response identifies a 
non-Western nationalist leader who reflects von 
Laue’s arguments about the use of Western ideals 
of freedom and self-determination.) 

“Overall, decolonization caused historians to 
reinterpret Western imperialism because it 
causes historians to think about it differently.” 
(The response includes an event or process from 
the second half of the twentieth century— 
decolonization—that is connected to historians 
reinterpreting Western imperialism.) 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student responses, what advice would  you offer  teachers to 
help them improve the student  performance on the exam?  

Students need practice identifying what is Western and what is non-Western. Some of this involves geography: Western 
European leaders will generally not fit into the category of “non-Western.” The term, though, takes on specific meaning 
with regard to imperialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Teachers should emphasize the nature of this 
designation as more than simple geography. A number of students correctly identified Latin American leaders as non-
Western nationalists despite the orientation in the Western hemisphere. Introducing students to the extensive 
historiography on the concept of “the West” can help them not only to understand the category of “the West” but also to 
practice reading and analyzing secondary sources. 

Students also need more familiarity with historiography. Specifically, teachers can further emphasize why historians 
change the way they understand and explain events and processes after a number of years. Students can better perform 
this kind of task when they understand that the events and processes happening around historians influence the history 
they create. Having students create a timeline not only of events, but also of “common historical interpretations” will help 
them with this type of analysis. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question?

Question #2  

Task: Short Answer  
Question  

Topic: Women Professions French  
Poster Primary Image   

Max. Points: 3  

Mean Score: 1.67  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Students were asked to evaluate an image of women in different social positions in France in the late nineteenth 
century to answer three questions. First, students were asked to identify one way in which the views reflected in the 
image represented a continuity with traditional notions of gender roles. Next, they were asked to identify one way in 
which the views reflected in the image represented a change from traditional gender roles. Lastly, they were asked to 
explain one way in which the format or intended audience of the source may have influenced the way in which gender 
roles were portrayed in the image. The question primarily addressed Topics 5.1., 5.9., and 9.5. of the AP World History: 
Modern Course and Exam Description. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Many students were able to identify the representation of gender inequality or patriarchy as a continuity depicted in the 
image. Students also recognized that the late nineteenth century produced changes in France as a result of the Industrial 
Revolution and the ways in which modernization and urbanization as well as factory work changed women’s lives. Many 
student responses identified gender inequality—often termed “patriarchy”—as a significant continuity in European 
history. There was less grounding in the development of proto-feminist or cultural changes that led to the changes in 
traditional gender roles. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most common misconception that students held about women’s roles in the late nineteenth century and in general 
was that women “didn’t work” until the modern period. Moreover, they seemed to believe that peasant classes were a 
new phenomenon represented by the image. Many students lacked the knowledge of context about France during the 
nineteenth century. They either wanted to talk about the French Revolution in the eighteenth century or the Great War 
in the twentieth. Context for France in the nineteenth century did not seem to be something the students were able to 
access from their learning. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

“The views shown in the image show a 
change in traditional gender roles 
because the poster shows women 
working in a field, a very drastic change 
in the traditional ideology during the 
nineteenth century.” (The response 
incorrectly identifies women engaged as 
agricultural workers in the nineteenth 
century as reflecting a change in 
traditional notions of gender roles.) 

•  

“One way in which the views in the image represent a 
change from traditional notions of gender roles is the 
fact that women are not bound to the house. Some of 
the women represented are working in factories.” (The 
response correctly identifies that the late nineteenth 
century allowed women to gain employment in a wider 
range of occupations, including that of a factory worker.)

•  

“Those  who started the  industrial  
revolution influenced  how women  
became.  Because the factories  and other  
jobs required men, women had  to  take  
care of the jobs other men used to do.”   
(The response  describes the  impact of the  
Industrial Revolution on women’s roles  
but  does not explain how  this is  connected  
to the format or intended audience of  the 
poster.)  

“The intended audience of the poster  influenced the  
way women and  gender  roles are p  ortrayed because  
this  poster was sold  to t  he masses. During  the late  
nineteenth  century,  many French people still believed  
that  women were meant to  serve their husband, and  
children. This  influenced the gender roles in the poster  
because the poster  would’ve been  largely controversial  
if it was not formatted to please the  masses.” (The 
response correctly explains that because the poster was  
intended for sale to individuals and institutions in France,  
it reflected more traditional gender roles so that it would  
have been controversial  to the sensibilities of a wide  
audience.)  

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

Students struggle with identifying continuities in modern European history. They typically demonstrate knowledge of 
important themes like changing gender roles or the emergence of different social classes, but their command of how far 
back certain processes stretch is more limited. Teachers should continue to emphasize the importance of long-term 
understanding of social forces in society and the context surrounding those changes. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

The following resources are available in AP Classroom to provide instructional support for a SAQ on the topic of gender 
roles, patriarchy, and how modernization and urbanization affected views of women: 

•  Unit 5, Topic 5.1, “The Enlightenment,” addresses the topic of the Enlightenment, women’s suffrage, and an 
emerging feminism that challenged political and gender hierarchies. It includes resources, such as AP Daily 
videos and topic questions that serve as formative assessment tools. 

•  Unit 5, Topic 5.9, “Society and the Industrial Age,” addresses the topic of new social classes and the 

differences between working- and middle-class women. It includes resources, such as AP Daily videos and

Question #3 

Task: Short Answer  
Question  

Topic:  Chinese Political System  
1200−1750 No Stimulus  

Max. Points: 3  

Mean Score: 1.18  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Students were asked to identify one continuity in the political system of China in the period 1200–1750. They then 
were asked to identify one change in the political system of China in the period 1200–1750. And, lastly, they were 
asked to explain one way in which political continuities in China influenced the development of the global economy in 
that same period. The question primarily addressed Topics 1.1., 2.1., and 4.4. of the AP World History: Modern Course 
and Exam Description. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

The students did quite well on this question. Teachers are clearly doing good work to introduce China during this 
period to students as their answers were strong. In part (a) the students frequently and accurately identified the civil 
service exam and the claim of The Mandate of Heaven as continuities. For part (b) they noted that China came to be 
ruled by non-Chinese dynasties like the Jin, Yuan, and Qing. Finally, students who successfully explained the global 
economic impact caused by the political continuities drew from their knowledge of global trade during the period and 
accurately identified the production of luxury goods for export and the global flow of silver from Japan and the 
Americas that was caused in part by China’s successful economy. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

While the overwhelming majority of students scored the first point, they still struggled with periodization for the 
question. The most common incorrect response indicated Communism as a continuity or change during the period. 
Many students also did well on part (c), but the biggest hurdle was explaining the how or why of events like Zhen He’s 
voyages or how the Mongols helped to expand the global economy.

Based on your  experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

Students continue to struggle with the “explain” part of the short answer questions. Working with students to develop 
clear how and why statements can help them to better prepare for the exam. Assist students in developing an 
understanding of the difference between summarizing or identifying and explaining or telling the story of how or why 
something occurred. Asking open-ended questions and giving students multiple opportunities to debate or engage in 
Socratic seminars can help them to understand that to explain is more than to identify accurately. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

The following resources are available in AP Classroom to provide instructional support for a SAQ on the topic of 
continuity and change in the political system of China and the impact on the global economy in the period 1200−1750:

Question #4 

Task: Short Answer  
Question  

Topic: South or Southeast Asia  
Political Systems 1750–1900        
No Stimulus  

Max. Points: 3  

Mean Score: 1.08  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

This question asked students to identify one continuity in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in the 
period 1750–1900. Then students were asked to identify one change in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia 
during the period. Finally, they were asked to explain a way that changes in the global economy led to changes in the 
political systems of these regions during the period. The question primarily addressed Topics 4.5., 5.8., and 6.1. of the 
AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Far fewer students selected this question than  Question 3.  It is likely that students felt far  less  confident answering  
questions about the political  systems of South and Southeast Asia during this  period. For part  (a)  many students 
effectively  identified the nature of  European control over South Asia (India in particular)  as  a continuity. Some students  
accurately alluded to continued  local  leadership in the face of centralized  control by the  Mughals or the British. For  part  
(c)  many  students explained the connection between the emerging global  manufacturing economy  and the increased  
colonization and European political control  of  South and  Southeast  Asia.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Accurate identification of region continued to be an issue for students. In many responses, part (a) and part (b) focused on 
China, Japan, or Korea—states in East Asia rather than South or Southeast Asia. Another significant gap in knowledge 
was the timing of independence for colonies in South and Southeast Asia. Responses frequently alluded to India breaking 
free of British control or the creation of a Pakistan from India, both of which occurred well after 1900. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

“One continuity of the political system of 
South and Southeast Asia was their strong 
sense of imperialism. During this time, 
empires like the Ming and Qing dynasties 
used conquering to sustain control. This 
control stayed strong through this time 
period because of the places they took 
over.” (The response incorrectly identifies 
imperialist impulses of the Ming and Qing 
dynasties as a continuity of political systems 
in South or Southeast Asia, but China is 
included in East Asia.) 

•  

“Kingdoms in South Asia like India, were still largely 
governed by princely states like the province of 
Bengal that were still officially ruled by the Nawab 
even after the collapse of the Mughals.” (The 
response correctly identifies the continued authority of 
local rulers like the Nawab of Bengal during and after 
the Mughal Empire.) 

•  

“One change in the political system of 
South Asia was the separation of India 

•  

“India’s government was controlled by the British for 
much of the 1750−1900 period.  Initially, India was

and Pakiistan. The regions  were poltically  
divided so  they  split.” (The response  
identifies  the split between India and 
Pakistan as a political  change  from  
1750−1900, but this is outside of the time  
period.)  

controlled by companies based  in Britain,  but  violent  
rebellions  led to full  British control of India.” (The  
response c  orrectly identifies that  while Britain  
maintained  power in India during  the entire period,  the 
nature of government  changed from indirect  to direct or  
“full control.”)  

•  

•  

“As the economy changed in Southeast 
Asia, many countries realized they could be 
close to, or fully-independent. Therefore 
giving countries such as India and 
Singapore reasons to break imperial ruling 
over their nations and branch out into an 
independent state which was self-
sufficient.” (The response attempts to 
connect economic self-sufficiency for states in 
South and Southeast Asia with political 
independence, but this is outside the time 
period.) 

“The Industrial Revolution led to the building of 
factories and mass manufacturing of goods. 
However, the British required more raw materials, 
and so began establishing colonies in order to 
retrieve these raw goods. India was ripe with raw 
materials, so the British set out to take control, 
eventually taking over the government and altering 
Indian political systems.” (The response correctly 
explains how the emergence of mass production during 
the Industrial Age led Britain to colonize India for the 
purposes of securing raw materials to produce 
manufactured goods.) 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

Students struggled with correctly identifying the states included within South and Southeast Asia. Teachers can continue 
to emphasize the relevant divisions within Asia as a way to better understand the implications of the development of 
global connections in this period. The different experiences for China and India, for example, with regard to European 
contact in this period might be a useful way of further clarifying how geography plays an important role in understanding 
the historical processes at work in these regions. Likewise, students continued to mistakenly identify decolonization 
movements as occurring before the twentieth century. Some of this is no doubt due to the various nationalist or reform 
movements in East Asia during the nineteenth century (particularly in China and Japan), and teachers might use these as 
way to contrast the different context in South and Southeast Asia. In particular, teachers can continue to emphasize the 
impact of the Second World War (perhaps more firmly rooted in the mid-1900s in students’ minds) on British, French, 
and Dutch colonial control as a way to help students correctly contextualize independence in South and Southeast Asia.

Question #1  

Task: Document-Based 
Question  

Topic:  Mexican Revolution   

Max. Points: 7  

Mean Score: 2.81  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on evidence 
within historical documents. This Document-Based Question (DBQ) asked students to evaluate the extent to which 
economic factors led to the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920. The question addressed Topic 7.1: Shifting Power After 
1900 of the AP World History Course Framework, and specifically Key Concept KC-6.2.II.D. The question provided 
opportunities for students to demonstrate all four of the historical reasoning skills, with a central focus on the skill of 
Causation. Responses were also expected to demonstrate the disciplinary practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence 
(primary sources) and Argument Development. The six text-based documents and one image provided evidence of 
causes of the Mexican Revolution. They provided students with multiple perspectives on the origins of the event, 
allowing students to develop their own argument as to the extent of economic influence on the origins of the 
revolution. Responses were expected to evaluate the sources, to add relevant historical detail, and to utilize the pieces 
of evidence to support and qualify an argument. Students also were asked to contextualize their essays by providing a 
larger historical framework within which the Mexican Revolution was situated. Responses were asked to provide 
explanation or description of the primary source documents’ point of view, historical situation, intended audience, 
and/or purpose. Students could also demonstrate complexity by creating nuanced arguments, extended discussions of 
key developments, and/or consistently corroborating documents by analyzing their commonalities and differences. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students were generally able to evaluate the sources provided to identify the extent of the impact of economic situations 
on the Mexican Revolution. For example, they regularly identified working conditions or labor relations in Mexico as an 
important factor in the development of the revolution. 

Most responses also successfully described historically relevant information from at least three documents. Many 
students were also able to use at least six documents as evidence in support of claims or arguments about the 
economic factors that led to the revolution. Students who were unsuccessful with this point frequently did not attempt 
to use at least six documents, and others combined documents into one vague statement that did not provide sufficient 
evidence of understanding to earn the point. 

Credit for Evidence Beyond the Documents was less frequently awarded in student responses. This was due mainly to 
students’ infrequent attempts at providing evidence that extended beyond what was provided in the documents. When 
students did attempt the point, they were successful when they referenced specific instances of European imperialism 
or made connections to other revolutions. Students very rarely were able to provide specific evidence beyond the 
documents of Mexican history that was relevant to the prompt. 

Student sourcing attempts were inconsistent. Students oftentimes merely restated the information provided in the 
source line or simply identified the source. When students were able to provide additional information or explanation 
about the source, they achieved the point. Teachers have clearly worked with students to understand that purpose is a 
form of sourcing. Purpose was found to be the most frequently successful attempt by students at the sourcing point. 
Many responses included a request for an additional document, seemingly unaware that the requirement to do so is no 
longer part of the task for the Document-Based Question. Finally, very few responses were able to demonstrate 
complexity. However, when they did, students were most likely to achieve this point when they created nuanced, 
developed arguments that showed understanding that the Mexican Revolution was happening in a global context.

These students frequently described that global phenomena and compared the Mexican Revolution to that in Russia at 
about the same time. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Though students were successful in creating lines of reasoning and comprehending the documents, their lack of 
understanding of Mexican history and chronology were the most frequent misconceptions or gaps in their knowledge. 
For example, students frequently did not distinguish between the Mexican Revolution (the topic of the prompt) and 
Mexico’s independence from Spain. Not only were these two separate historical events, but they happened in different 
centuries. Working with students to develop their chronological skills and their understanding of the specific nature of 
Central and Latin American independence and revolutionary movements might assist students in avoiding these gaps 
or misconceptions. 

Moreover, students continue to struggle with contextualization. Working with students on chronology and 
periodization will additionally assist these students. Students seem to not be able to effectively move from knowledge 
of what is merely happening at the same time, for example, the Russian Revolution, to proper historically relevant 
contextualization of the developments addressed in the prompt. Students were most likely to get context when they 
connected Enlightenment thought and previous revolutionary thinking to the events of the Mexican Revolution. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

“The Mexican Revolution established 
Mexico’s independence from Spain.” 
(Attempted contextualization.) 

•  

“Mexico won its independence from Spain in the 
nineteenth century after a series of calls for an end of 
oppression. However, even with independence social 
structures continued to hinder economic progress, 
with Creoles on the top of the economic and social 
ladders and the lower classes suffering and 
remaining unhappy. This led eventually to the 
Mexican Revolution.” 

•  

“Document 2 was a newspaper drawing that 
showed people being beaten.” 

•  

“Document 2 was intended to illustrate the violence 
and oppression of the government on the working 
classes in order to draw attention to the need for a 
political or revolutionary response.” 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

Teachers have clearly worked with their students on reading comprehension, understanding important themes such as 
revolution and modernization. Teachers might consider spending time developing intentional practices that help 
students to develop a toolbox of understanding strategies related to themes such as the economy as appeared in this 
question. Other common themes that students struggled with are understanding humans in the environment and social 
interactions and organization. Teachers could easily introduce contemporary examples of the economy to help 
students understand the key features of an economy such as taxes, monetary systems, and trade. Creating a word wall 
in the classroom with these themes at the top and having students fill in specific key terms and examples under the 
theme during the course of a unit could help them to create a visual memory of the features of these themes. 

As stated earlier, students were most often successful when they provided the purpose of a source by showing the link 
between the document and the economic factors of the revolution. AP classroom has excellent daily personal progress 
checks and instructor videos that can develop a scaffolded approach to this skill. Students need practice with sourcing

for understanding the document’s connection to the argument.

Question #2  

Task: Long Essay  
Question  

Topic:  New Economic and  
Commercial Practices, 1200−1450   

Max. Points: 6  

Mean Score: 2.40  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ ability to analyze the role that economic and/or 
commercial practices played in affecting trade between 1200 and 1450 C.E. It prompted students to address topics 
included in 2.1: The Silk Roads, Topic 2.3; Exchange in the Indian Ocean, Topic 2.4; Trans-Saharan Trade Routes; 
and/or 2.7, Comparison of Economic Exchange in the AP World History Curriculum and Framework. The question was 
open geographically to allow responses about multiple regions and a time period that guided students to the topics 
listed above, but also open to student responses that demonstrated familiarity with developments in European trade 
toward the end of the period. 

The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of economic and 
commercial practices on trade, and the students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a 
historical context, use at least two specific examples of evidence, use the evidence to support an argument in response 
to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame an argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the 
historical development. Students could use any historical thinking skill to demonstrate this understanding, and we saw 
successful responses that compared the developments of different trade routes, discussed effects of specific 
developments on individual trade routes, or evaluated the extent of the changes and impact on trade routes over time. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students frequently chose this question, demonstrating a level of familiarity and confidence with their knowledge of 
major trade routes during the period 1200−1450 C.E. Students who chose Question 2 typically focused on identifying 
specific commercial practices or technological innovations that impacted trade on the three main routes listed in the 
prompt. Students were generally successful in making a claim or fashioning a thesis to frame their argument, although 
these were at times too vague to earn points. Teachers have done an admirable job of exposing students to these trade 
routes, and many students had specific examples to provide as evidence such as the use of caravanserai, the camel 
and camel saddle, and improved maritime technologies. Students also showed a notable global perspective, with many 
responses addressing multiple trade routes and discussing the development of trade economies and cultural diffusion. 

Students struggled with deploying evidence in a way that clearly supported their argument. Many students presented a 
summary of developments, listing those developments, rather than explaining how or why the development impacted 
trade. Chronology also continues to be a significant struggle for students, as demonstrated by frequent responses 
citing the development of steamships and railroads, which are significantly outside the time period. Students who were 
able to recall specific developments in trade tended to earn more points; however, most students struggled to 
demonstrate complexity with this question. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most significant and common misconception or gap in knowledge was chronology. Students often wrote accurate 
evaluations of the impact of developmpents such as the railroad or Columbian Exchange on trade; however, these were 
outside of the time period of the prompt and could not earn credit. Students also were more likely to struggle with the 
specific expectation of the prompt to address “economic and/or commercial practices,” choosing instead to focus on 
the more familiar cultural diffusion facilitated by trade routes.

Students also struggled with the concept of contextualization for this question. Notably, students might have avoided 
the point because they focused on the aspect of contextualization as “in the period immediately before,” and the course 
begins in 1200. It is important for teachers to emphasize to students that contextualization can also be in the same time 
period, and outside the topic of the prompt, and for students to practice this type of contextualization. Students who 
addressed the development of large empires, which increased the need for trade, or who described the growth of cities 
along trade routes, facilitating the spread of these economic and commercial practices, could earn the contextualization 
point. Some students simply rewrote the background information provided before the prompt; however, this did not 
earn contextualization as restating the prompt does not earn a point. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

“In the period circa 1200–1450, commerce along 
exchange networks such as the Silk Road 
involved many new economic and commercial 
practices.” (Attempt at contextualization simply 
repeats the source material.) 

•  

“The development of the railroad allowed 
merchants to move more goods quickly, 
impacting trade significantly.” (Attempt at 
evidence is outside of chronological time period. ) 

•  

•  

“Throughout the time period of 1200–1450 societies 
were becoming more and more connected. As 
travelers along the Silk Road stopped in the same 
place to rest, cities began to grow up. The 
development of cities like Samarkand and Damascus 
allowed traders to share commercial and economic 
developments to make trade easier.” (Earns 
contextualization by identifying the development of cities 
as hubs for shared practices. ) 

“The implementation of flying money, or paper 
indications of larger amounts of gold and silver, 
allowed merchants to travel with less risk and lighter 
packs, making travel much faster and more safe.” 
(Successful evidence provided—“flying money”— is 
then attached to an argument that this development 
made travel “faster and more safe.” With a second piece 
of evidence this could earn both evidence points. ) 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

It is important for teachers to provide opportunities for students to practice making arguments and responding to prompts 
with chronological structure. This can be an excellent opportunity for review at the end of a unit or at the end of the 
course. Provide students with notecards or terms and have them place these concepts on a timeline around the 
classroom. They can work in groups or individually, and they can use notes and books as resources or attempt first from 
memory and then “check” themselves with books and notes. This same activity can work as practice for 
contextualization. Once the timeline is created, the teacher can ask students to brainstorm a list of “What else is going 
on?” in different topics or geographical areas. For example, if we have just created a timeline of trade developments, I 
might ask students to address what cultural developments are present, and then connect them to economics. Another 
opportunity for students to work on contextualization is to provide a prompt for students but only require a 
contextualization response or to develop a contextualization together as a class. Students benefit from repeated modeling 
of this skill in class and the opportunity to connect their knowledge to other topics similar to the prompt.

Question #3  

Task: Long Essay  
Question  

Topic:  Impact of European Expansion 
on South/East Asian  Economies,   
1450–1750  

Max. Points: 6  

Mean Score: 2.17  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

This question addressed Topic 4.4: Maritime Empires Established and Topic 4.5: Maritime Empires Maintained and 
Developed of the AP World History Curriculum and Framework. The question was open geographically to allow 
responses about multiple areas, with the main student responses focused on South Asia (India) and East Asia (China 
and Japan); however, areas in South East Asia were also accepted if presented correctly. The question was designed to 
allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of European expansion on the countries located in 
South and East Asia, with a specific focus on economic impacts such as the choice to isolate from the global economy 
or the growing dependence on the European nations. Students were expected to present a historically defensible 
thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to 
the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning 
skills to frame or structure their argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development 
that is the focus of the prompt. Students were able to use any historical thinking skill to demonstrate this 
understanding, and we saw successful responses that compared the impact of European expansion on two areas, 
discussed specific elements of European expansion along with their specific impacts, or evaluated the way impacts of 
European expansion changed over the time period provided. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question was the least frequent choice for students, possibly because students felt less comfortable with the the 
history of East and South Asia during the time period of the prompt. Students who chose Question 3 often struggled 
because of a lack of chronological knowledge, writing well-developed essays centered on the Opium Wars and the 
Boxer Rebellion in China, two events that were not relevant to the period referenced in the prompt. Successful 
responses were more likely to address the impacts of British expansion in India or on efforts by China and Japan to 
prevent European expansion through the implementation of isolation policies. If they stayed within the time period, 
students were generally successful in creating a thesis/claim for their argument, though these claims were sometimes 
too vague to earn points. Successful responses often showed a detailed grasp of East Asian and South Asian 
government systems and were able to discuss specific European economic actions such as joint-stock companies and 
the development of the Dutch trading systems in the Indian Ocean. Students struggled at times with deploying this 
evidence in a way that supported their argument, defaulting to simpler skills such as summarizing European actions or 
describing South/East Asian economic systems. Geography also posed a problem for some students, with the time 
period leading to discussion of European expansion in the Americas—content which could be effective 
contextualization if applied accurately but did not respond directly to the prompt. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most significant and common element of struggle for students was the chronological element of the question. 
Students often wrote accurate evaluations of the impact of European expansion on the development of the Opium 
Wars, and while evidence about the Opium trade could be effectively argued, responses that focused specifically on 
the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion were common and ineffective because they fell outside the time period. 

Students continue to struggle with the concept of complexity, with many responses focusing on “retelling” the process 
of European expansion rather than developing a complex and nuanced argument about the impact of this expansion on 
the economies of East and South Asia. Responses focused heavily on the European actions, often expanding on the

negative impacts of this expansion on the social and political realms of the East and South Asian populations 
(explaining the British banning of widow sacrifice, or Sati, for example) but did not connect the impact to the 
economies of these locations. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

“The first Opium War showed how the British 
had used their sale of opium to take over 
Chinese economy.” (Attempt at evidence through 
reference to Opium War outside the time period.) 

•  

•  

“The British needed to keep more money, so 
they sold the Chinese Opium.” (Presents 
evidence in a straightforward way as factual 
description. Does not demonstrate complexity.) 

•  

“In an effort to counter the flow of silver into 
China, British merchants began to provide 
opium, developing a customer base that was 
heavily dependent and needed a constant 
supply of the drug, giving the British an 
increasing ability to impact the Chinese 
economy.” (Deploys evidence successfully by 
focusing on opium sales, rather than the 
Opium War. ) 

“As the British solidified their control over 
India, they were increasingly able to dictate 
Indian production, including increasing the 
production of opium. This drug could then 
be sold to the Chinese, who had otherwise 
no desire for any European products. 
Through this process, the British built an 
economic triangle of power, allowing them 
to profit through both controlling the 
production and creating demand for a 
product that also rendered their customers 
less able to create market competition.” 
(Begins to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the nuance of the opium 
trade, going beyond a simple presentation of 
the sale of opium to a nuanced understanding 
of the economic integration of markets.) 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

To address complexity, teachers can continue to challenge students to think beyond “what” happened to a continued 
exploration of the topic by asking the question “so what?” This might also be accomplished by discussing a given 
development and considering what other causes or explanations might be applied (i.e., a counterargument). One way to 
do this is through in-class discussion. Another way is to have students keep a journal focused on higher-level questions 
as topics are discussed in class and occasionally have them choose one question to develop as a short written response, 
specifically challenging a “typical” explanation. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

The following resources are available in AP Classroom to provide instructional support for an LEQ on the topic of 
European expansion and its impact on the economies of East and/or South Asian states:

Question #4 

Task:  Long Essay  
Question  

Topic:  The Great Depression and 
Economic Policies Change  

Max. Points: 6  

Mean Score: 1.82  

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

This question addressed Topic 7.4: Economy in the Interwar Period and Topic 7.6: Causes of World War II of the AP 
World History Curriculum and Framework. The question was open geographically to allow responses from any nation 
outside of the United States, though the vast majority of responses focused on developments in Germany and Russia. The 
question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the Great Depression and its global 
impacts, with the specific exclusion of the United States helping to focus responses on global issues. With the close 
proximity to the First World War and the Second World War, two topics about which students tend to have extensive 
knowledge, the question provided opportunities for ample content and context. Students were expected to present a 
historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the prompt, use at least two specific examples of 
evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, use 
historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the 
historical development that is the focus of the prompt. Students were able to use any historical thinking skill to 
demonstrate this understanding, and we saw successful responses that compared the impact of the Great Depression on 
two areas (most commonly a comparison of Russia and Germany), discussed how specific elements of the Great 
Depression (such as inflation) led to specific government responses, or responses that addressed how government 
responses changed as the twentieth century progressed. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question was a common choice for students, emphasizing their familiarity with content associated with the World 
Wars, despite this content coming at the end of the course when teachers might have been pressed for time at the end 
of the school year. Students who chose Question 4 often scored very well in the Evidence and Evidence Analysis 
categories, providing multiple examples of evidence connected to government responses to the Great Depression 
including discussing the economic struggles of the Weimar Republic, the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, and the 
implementation by totalitarian governments of strict economic control motions. Students were extremely successful in 
demonstrating success with contextualization due to understanding of (and application of) the Treaty of Versailles. In 
contrast, students typically struggled and did not address the “government response” and “economic” elements of the 
prompt. Rather than focus on these requirements, responses that were not successful addressed the development of 
the Second World War itself, conflicts therein, and the rise of new political entities without connecting to the economic 
policies. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most significant and common element of struggle for students was the thematic focus on economics and the 
specificity of government responses (versus general developments). For example, it was fairly common for students to 
address the idea of inflation as a specific government response, rather than a result of government policy. In addition, 
students struggled with providing a general political history of the time period between the First World War and the 
Second World War, without demonstrating understanding of the economic impacts that were the focus of the question. 

Chronology was also a problem with student responses centered on the Soviet Union. Many responses presented the 
Russian Revolution and rise of communism in the Soviet Union as a government response to the Great Depression, a 
chronological error. While these responses might have been well developed and supported by detailed content, they 
were not an accurate response to the prompt provided. A similar error was found in responses that focused exclusively 
on the United States and U.S. government responses to the Great Depression. While extensive, accurate information 
might be presented, it was outside the scope of the prompt.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding 

•  

•  

“Adolf Hitler rose as the head of the Nazi 
party, and took over the government of 
Germany after the Great Depression.” 
(Focuses on political developments with no 
connection to the economic policies of the 
government.) 

“Lenin’s ideas led to the overthrow of the 
Tsar and the establishment of the 
communist government.” (Addresses 
content from outside the time period. This 
content might be successful, if presented 
correctly, as contextualizaiton, but it does not 
address the prompt.) 

•  

•  

“As Germany struggled with the economic depression 
as a result of reparations and global economic issues, 
the fascist leader Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party 
implemented significant government building projects 
such as the autobahn and other significant government 
investments like rebuilding the military.” (Connects the 
rise of the Nazi party with the economic policies issued as 
a result of the Great Depression.) 

“Stalin’s complete control of production under 
communist policies allowed him to dictate what and 
how much would be produced. The communist 
structure isolated the USSR from the global economy 
in many ways, and led to less need for government 
policy to change in response to the Great Depression 
than was found in many other nations.” (Accurately 
addresses Soviet policy within the time period of the 
prompt, as well as indicating the impact of communism 
on the Soviet economy. ) 

Based on your experience at the AP®  Reading  with student  responses, what advice would  you offer teachers to  
help them improve the student performance on the exam?  

It remains important for teachers to provide opportunities for students to practice with chronological structure. One way 
to practice this is to provide students with a window of dates or a specific time period (i.e., “Twentieth Century” or 
“1450−1900”) and ask students to list as many specific details as they can from different regions of the world. This can be 
done on large sheets of butcher paper around the room labeled with different regions. Have students travel from page to 
page adding any specific details they can think of that fall within the presented time period and also cross off details 
added by other students that are outside the time period. This activity encourages both critical thinking and memory of 
content. 

To work on thematic recognition, encourage students to deconstruct all prompts they see, identifying the key elements of 
the prompt: time period, thematic focus, and task. To scaffold, consider doing this together as a full class prior to the first 
few essays, then with a partner or in a small group, and eventually individually. Remind students that on the AP Test 
they have a reading period during which they can focus on this task as they brainstorm for their essays. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

The following resources are available in AP Classroom to provide instructional support for a LEQ on the topic of 
governments’ economic responses to the Great Depression: 

•  Unit 7, Topic 7.4, “Economy in the Interwar Period,” addresses the topic of the Great Depression and how 

some governments took a more active role in economic life. It includes resources, such as AP Daily videos and 
topic questions that serve as formative assessment tools. 

•  Unit 7, Topic 7.6, “Causes of World War II,” addresses the topic of the global economic crises caused by the 

Great Depression and the rise of fascist and totalitarian regimes. It includes resources, such as AP Daily videos 
and topic questions that serve as formative assessment tools.
