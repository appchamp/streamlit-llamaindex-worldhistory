Short Answer Question 2 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“First and most important in the early modern era [1450–1750 C.E.] is the intensified human land use in 
every world region. Rising human numbers put increasing pressure on the land. Almost invariably [human] 
expansion caused a reduction in the quantity and diversity of vegetation or, to put it in other terms, a 
reduction in biomass and biodiversity. That is, sedentary cultivation depended on selection of one or a few 
favored plant species . . . in place of a variety of grass, shrubs, and trees. . . . Agriculture was and continues 
to be the single most important means by which humans change the world’s lands and its ecosystems. 

John F. Richards, historian, The Unending Frontier: An Environmental 
History of the Early Modern World, 2003 

a) Identify and explain ONE historically specific example of intensified human land use in the period 1450–

1750 C.E. that would support the author’s argument. 

b) Identify and explain ONE historically specific example from the period before 1450 C.E. in which humans 

interacted with the environment in ways similar to those described in the passage. 

c) Identify and explain ONE late-twentieth-century development that likely explains historians’ interest in 

the subject of the passage.

Short Answer Question 2 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 
•  The establishment of plantation agriculture in the Americas after 1492 resulted in new forms of 

intensive agriculture for cash crops for export, such as sugar, that reduced the agricultural diversity of 
the region. 

•  The Aztecs altered the surrounding landscape through the use of chinampas in order to produce 

specific crops.  

•  The Columbian Exchange dramatically changed the biodiversity and expansion of agriculture in Ming 

and Qing China through the cultivation of sweet potatoes, maize, and potatoes. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 
•  The agricultural revolution in Mesopotamia resulted in intensive cultivation of cereal grains and use of 

irrigation, leading to increased salinization of the soil.  

•  Greater rice cultivation and the spread of cash crops like tea and cotton during the Song Dynasty led to 

transformation of the landscape to meet the economic needs of the rising merchant class. 

•  An agricultural revolution in medieval Europe led to the use of the three-field system, resulting in 

increased deforestation as more land was cleared for cultivation. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 
•  The Green Revolution’s focus on increasing agricultural productivity in the 1960s led historians to 

consider other events or times when human agency also impacted the ecosystem. 

•  The growing environmental movement of the late twentieth century brought greater attention to the 

damaging effects of deforestation and pollution. 

•  The massive mobilization and relocation of people to increase agricultural production in China during 

the 1950s and 1960s led to environmental stresses.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 2 

Overview 

This question presented students with a passage written by a historian who studies environmental history 
in the early modern period (1450−1750 C.E.). Students were asked to identify and explain a historically 
specific example of intensified human land use in that period that would support the author’s argument, 
one historically specific example of intensified human land use in the period before 1450 C.E. that would 
also support the author’s argument, and one late-twentieth-century development that explains the 
historian’s interest in the subject of the passage. The question tests students’ ability to comprehend the 
passage and then apply their understanding relative to the use of land in a historically meaningful way 
across three different time periods. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned the point because its discussion of how the establishment of cash-crop plantations 
by the Spanish and the Portuguese in Latin America reduced biodiversity supports Richards’s argument 
about land use. 

b) The response earned the point because its discussion of how rice cultivation and the introduction of 
champa rice (i.e., “fasting-growing rice from Vietnam”) reduced biodiversity in China in the period before 
1450 C.E. is a historically specific example of how humans interacted with the environment in ways similar to 
those described by Richards. 

c) The response earned the point because its discussion of how the Green Revolution led to increased 
concerns about the reduction of biodiversity serves as a late-twentieth-century example that would explain 
historians’ interest in the subject of intensified human land use. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 2 

a) The response did not earn the point because coal mining is not an example of intensified land use and 
would not support Richards’s argument. 

b) The response earned the point because its discussion of how early human settlement in river-valley 
civilizations reduced soil nutrients is a historically specific example of how humans interacted with the 
environment in ways similar to those described by Richards. 

c) The response earned the point because it identifies and explains how climate change and deforestation 
affect ecosystems, and it states that these changes have led historians to become interested in the subject of 
intensified human land use.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued) 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because it does not use a specific historical example to explain 
explicitly how the development of agriculture would support Richards’s argument. 

b) The response did not earn the point because it does not use a specific historical example to explain how 
human migration led humans to interact with the environment in ways similar to those described by 
Richards.  

c) The response earned the point because it connects debates about global warming’s “stress on the earth” 
to explain why historians such as Richards might be interested in environmental history.
