Student Performance Q&A: 

2007 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2007 free-response questions for AP® World History were 
written by the Chief Reader, Merry Wiesner-Hanks of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee,  
and Question Leaders Sharon Cohen of Springbrook High School in Silver Spring, Maryland; 
Joseph (Jay) Harmon of Cypress Woods High School in Cypress, Texas; and William Zeigler of 
San Marcos High School in California. They give an overview of each free-response question 
and of how students performed on the question, including typical student errors. General 
comments regarding the skills and content that students frequently have the most problems 
with are included. Some suggestions for improving student performance in these areas are 
also provided. Teachers are encouraged to attend a College Board workshop to learn 
strategies for improving student performance in specific areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

As with previous document-based questions, students were required to answer the prompt using 
their analyses of a preselected set of documents. The prompt was straightforward and asked 
students to write an essay regarding Han and Roman attitudes toward technology, based on their 
analyses of eight documents. The eight documents, four from Han China and four from Rome, were 
written by upper-class males and reflect little diversity in social opinion or class within their 
societies. In addition to showing the societies’ attitudes toward technology, students were to 
demonstrate their understanding of the documents by grouping them and analyzing the authors’ 
points of view. Finally, in order to provide evidence that they understood the broader context 
presented by the question, students were to identify an additional type of document and explain 
how it would help illustrate the attitudes of the Han and/or Romans toward technology. 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score of 2.84 out of a possible 9 points was significantly lower than in the two previous 
years (the mean was 3.27 in 2006 and 3.91 in 2005). The reason for the lower scores in 2007 had less 
to do with student performance than with changes in the generic scoring guidelines that were 
introduced in 2006, though there was a general feeling among Readers that more students than in 
the past were attempting to fulfill all of the requirements of the document-based question: writing 
a thesis in the introduction or conclusion, using all of the documents, analyzing multiple points of 
view, explaining the need for additional documents, and categorizing the documents into multiple

groups. Although the prompt did not require a comparison, many students effectively used a 
comparative structure in order to develop their arguments. 

In addition, many students showed their understanding of the time period by providing a wealth of 
outside information regarding the Han dynasty and the Roman Empire. Essays included 
information about Confucianism, the Silk Routes, the connections between the two empires, 
Roman imperial expansion, and philosophical principles from both empires. Many students were 
also able to show that they understood how the documents illustrated Han Confucian relationships 
and a concern for the peasantry in contrast to the Roman hierarchical class structure with its lack 
of regard for the lower-class worker. These insights were most often expressed in the students’ 
discussion of Han concern for all people as opposed to the Roman concern for glory. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Although students did make a greater attempt than in the past to fulfill all of the requirements of 
the essay, many still fell short in these attempts, repeatedly failing to provide analysis. 
Furthermore, they often did not answer the prompt by showing Han or Roman attitudes toward 
technology but rather focused on issues regarding technology itself. The attitudes toward 
technology expressed in the Han documents were much clearer than those in the Roman ones and 
were usually better understood in student responses. However, students often misinterpreted the 
Han official, Huan Guan, stating that he did not like technology, whereas he viewed the 
government-sponsored technology as inferior. In addition, students frequently misread both the 
Seneca and Cicero documents as being negative toward technology, whereas they more accurately 
represent negative attitudes toward the working class who used the technology. Finally, the 
documents by Huan Tan (3), the Han government (4), and Plutarch (6) were often attributed to their 
respective subjects (mythical Emperor Fuxi, Governor Tu Shih, and Tribune Gaius Gracchus) 
instead of the actual authors. 

Many students continued to provide limited theses in their introductions, often having clearer and 
more complete theses in the conclusions. Thesis statements also tended to be rambling 
proclamations rather than succinct statements of purpose. Students most often grouped the 
documents in terms of some type of Han or Roman characteristics, instead of looking at broader 
means of categorization. They received no credit for grouping the documents just as Han and 
Roman, because that information was already provided. 

In a welcome development, students generally showed their understanding of the documents by 
paraphrasing rather than presenting long quotes, but as in past document-based questions, they 
often did not effectively use the sources as evidence of their theses and instead relied on the 
Reader to make the connections for them. 

Although students certainly attempted to write about the authors’ points of view and to request 
additional documents that could supplement their assessment of the sources provided, they did 
not follow through with the analysis required in both of these areas. Often they would note that a 
document was written by an upper-class person but would not explain why or how this might have 
informed the author’s point of view. Documents by peasants were most often asked for, but 
students missed the point by not explaining why or how this would help broaden an understanding 
of Han or Roman attitudes toward technology. Again, they relied on the Reader to make the 
connections, not clarifying their own analysis of the point of view or the need for an additional 
document.

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

Students continue to lose credit by not effectively responding to the prompt. Although this was a 
straightforward question, students often did not discuss “attitudes toward technology,” but rather 
just “technology.” Teachers should stress throughout the course that students must focus on and 
fully address the prompt. They should be encouraged to read the prompt and problem-solve their 
answer prior to reading the documents. Teaching the five overarching themes outlined in the 
Course Description and encouraging students to use these themes in categorizing their response 
will aid them in developing a stronger thesis and appropriate groupings of the sources. Helping 
students write succinct and clear thesis statements that directly address and answer the prompt 
continues to be a necessity. 

Teachers must also stress the importance of genuine analysis. Students, for the most part, 
understood the documents but did not use them effectively as evidence to support their claims. 
They asked for additional documents but did not explain why the documents requested would 
contribute to their theses. They noted the authors’ points of view but did not account for why the 
authors expressed their particular opinions. In each case, students lost credit for not expressly 
elucidating the information that they provided. In all cases, students needed to explicitly analyze 
the documents, points of view, and requests for additional references. In this vein, students should 
be encouraged to write thoughtful, structured, and analytical essays without resorting to “tricks” to 
gain points. The request for an additional document and the discussion of point of view should be 
an organic part of the essay, not tacked on to the introduction or mechanically appended in an 
additional paragraph at the end as an afterthought. Teachers should encourage historical thinking 
skills (the “habits of mind”) that are relevant to these tasks. 

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

Students were expected to trace and explain the changes and continuities from 1914 to the present 
in how peoples and their leaders in one of three regions (the Middle East, Southeast Asia, or sub-
Saharan Africa) created either distinct or unique national identities, using evidence from specific 
countries. For example, what would make a nation-state Turkish or Vietnamese or South African 
throughout the twentieth century? 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score of the continuity/change-over-time question was 1.45 out of a possible 9 points, 
significantly lower than the mean of 3.02 in 2006 and 3.40 in 2005. One reason for this very low 
average score was the large number of responses that scored zero, though there were also many 
excellent essays. Students showed peoples’ desire for sovereignty within the global context of 
major world events and processes in the period from 1914 to the present. Specifically, they were 
able to explain how the desire for self-determination was often affected by European imperialism 
and the world wars. They often mentioned how reforms made by the new political leaders led to 
secular national identities, and they frequently referred to how religious beliefs affected national 
identity by unifying peoples into communities in a region—for example, Islam in the Middle East. 
The most common approach to an analysis of the formation of national identity focused on how

imperialism, the Cold War, and globalization expanded and limited political and economic options. 
Responses were distributed fairly evenly among the three regions of the Middle East, Southeast 
Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Generic Problems  
Most students still had a difficult time explaining the historical importance of continuity in a time 
period. Although they attempted to address the concept of constancy, their statements tended to 
be very general and not connected to the question. This year, for example, students who 
mentioned the endurance of religion in a region but did not link that historical stability with the 
formation of national identity did not score points for continuity.  

As on previous exams, many students could not correctly identify countries in a region. A 
substantial number incorrectly claimed that China, India, Japan, or Korea was in Southeast Asia, 
and that Algeria, Morocco, or Egypt was part of sub-Saharan Africa. A few students erroneously 
placed Afghanistan in the Middle East. Some also confused regions, countries, and cities. For 
instance, students commonly used “Pakistan” when they meant “Palestine,” and they regularly 
claimed that the continent of Africa is a country, or that Jerusalem is a state. 

Writing a complete thesis also remained a challenge. Moreover, students persisted in just listing 
facts instead of using them as specific evidence to support the overall argument of the thesis. 

Specific Problems  
Many students simply were not prepared to identify and analyze the changes and continuities in 
the formation of national identity. They ignored the analysis task in the question and tried to write 
anything they knew about nationalism instead. These essays appeared to be “data dumps” instead 
of analytical arguments.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

Because students still struggle with continuity, teachers need to present models for analyzing 
continuity over time in specific time periods and across time periods. With more preparation and 
practice, students should be able to internalize their understanding of the importance of continuity 
as a contrast to historical changes and as connected to the global processes key to world history. 
Teachers should reinforce that restating the prompt is not an adequate thesis statement and keep 
working with students on writing a thesis that accurately and completely addresses the question 
asked, not the one the students want to answer. Students also could benefit from more practice 
with writing timed essays in response to questions that they have not seen before.  

Overall, students need to develop their historical thinking skills. They have to recognize the task in 
the question asked, present an analytical argument that answers the essay questions on the 
examination, and address both change and continuity with specific evidence. Students must also 
be able to accurately identify regions according to the designations presented in the AP World 
History Course Description. Equally important is the geographic skill of distinguishing between 
regions, countries, and cities. Teachers should point out to students that the names of regions and

countries have changed over time and help them to be flexible and correct in their use of 
geographical names and terms in their writing. 

Question 3 

What was the intent of this question? 

The comparative question asked, “Within the period from 1450 to 1800, compare the processes 
(e.g., political, social, economic) of empire building in the Spanish Empire with the empire-building 
processes in ONE of the following: The Ottoman Empire OR The Russian Empire.” The heart of the 
question gets to the idea of empire building, not merely the existence of empire. As part of the 
core-scoring method, students were to develop an explicit thesis that compared and contrasted the 
process of empire building in Spain with either the Ottoman Empire or the Russian Empire. 
Second, students were to address similarities and differences in the development of the two 
empires chosen in their thesis. Third, evidence supporting empire building in both empires was 
required. Fourth, students were to provide a direct comparison between the two empires related to 
the process of empire building. Finally, in the basic core, students were instructed to analyze a 
reason for a similarity or difference between the two empires. Students who fulfilled all of these 
core points were eligible for up to 2 expanded core points by providing a well-written essay that 
could include, but not necessarily be limited to, a strong thesis, numerous examples of evidence, 
and/or several direct comparisons.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

Generally, students scored higher on the comparative essay than on the other two essays in 2007, 
and higher than in previous years. The mean score on the comparative question was 2.99 out of a 
possible 9 points, higher than the 2006 mean of 2.60 and the 2005 mean of 2.56. One of the factors 
in students’ improved performance may be that this was perceived as one of the more 
“mainstream” comparative questions since the inaugural AP World History Exam in 2002. In 
addition, students seem to have been taught to make specific direct comparisons rather than 
listing characteristics of each empire separately and leaving it to the Reader to infer similarities or 
differences. Almost all of the students who made a reasonable attempt to answer the question 
demonstrated knowledge of the Spanish and the Ottoman or Russian empires. More students—and 
logically, their teachers—appear to understand that the comparative question requires both 
comparisons and contrasts between two societies.  

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Many students misinterpreted the question and addressed similarities and differences between 
two empires but did not compare the process of empire building, with the result that they received 
no credit for the “thesis point.” Similarly, many students provided accurate facts about the empires 
addressed in the question but gave no data or examples in support of a comparison of the 
processes of empire building. Those students did not, therefore, earn core points for evidence. The 
analysis core point was another area where students appeared to struggle. They would make a 
comparison but not explain or elucidate it. Perhaps such failures can be attributed to the fact that 
this core point was introduced in the 2005-06 school year and may therefore be a new development 
to many teachers.

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

It appears that teachers and students understand the purpose of the comparative question to a 
greater degree each year. On the whole, students seem to understand that the comparative 
question requires writing an essay that includes both comparisons and contrasts. A higher 
percentage of students than in the inaugural exam demonstrate the required ability to make a 
direct, relevant comparison between two societies. Here, teaching students to make comparisons 
has had results. Teachers now need to do additional instruction on explaining the reasons for a 
similarity or a difference. Based on the 2007 exam results, teachers should also emphasize that 
students must understand and address the prompt if they wish to perform well. Students need to 
use the five minutes of planning provided for this question to make sure that they have “parsed”—
that is, analyzed critically—exactly what the prompt requires. AP World History teachers should 
continue to develop students’ thesis-writing and analytical skills.
