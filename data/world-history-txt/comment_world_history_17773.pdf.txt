AP® WORLD HISTORY 
2002 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Sample 1: Score 9 

Meets the Basic Core in all categories. The Point of View is met in a number of places, including p. 2,  
paragraph 2 “…shows a Muslim scholar pointing out the faults of trade from a theological standing,” (See Basic 
Core Rubric) and in the same paragraph, “…Muslim merchants began to show disapproval of new aspects of 
trade even amongst themselves, basing their arguments on the old religious traditions of the past.”  Expanded 
Core points come from the use of outside information, the persuasive use of documents, and careful and 
insightful analysis of the documents, among others. 

Sample 2: Score 7 

Contains an acceptable thesis, which is split between the first and last paragraphs of the essay.  It meets all the 
Basic Core criteria, but it does misinterpret Document 6 somewhat. It contains multiple examples of Point of 
View and requests two additional appropriate documents, “… This would have been a good place for a church 
official to speak,” and “…a chart of how much of the merchant’s profits were given to the church on an annual 
basis.” 

Sample 3: Score 5 

Contains an acceptable thesis that is split, i.e., portions appear in the first and last paragraphs. It uses a sufficient 
number of documents, supports the thesis in addressing Change Over Time, demonstrates understanding of the 
documents, and groups documents to make comparisons, It contains no Point of View, and does not cite an 
additional, needed document. 

Sample 1: Score 9 

Question 2 

Shows change nicely in both regions through a flow of events, referring to several global trade patterns including 
slave trade and Cold War. For expanded core:  internal comparisons where South/ Southeast Asia is compared to 
Latin America (1) and more than one place mentioned in South and Southeast Asia, as well as differentiation in 
Latin America (2).
