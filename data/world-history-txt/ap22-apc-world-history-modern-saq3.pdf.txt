Question 3: No Stimulus 

3  points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE  technological development that  directly contributed  to the   
Columbian Exchange.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The spread of navigation technologies, such as astrolabes, made it possible for 

Europeans to voyage around the world. 

•  New ship designs, such as caravels, increased European voyages across oceans. 
•  Cartographic advances helped Europeans better navigate open seas. 

(B) 

Identify ONE  benefit of the transfer of  crops and/or domesticated  animals during the 
Columbian  Exchange for the populations involved.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Domesticated animals from Europe led to more efficient farming in the Americas. 
•  More diverse nutrients benefited populations. 
•  The spread and use of new crops from the Americas that were more productive or 

more reliable led to population growth in Afro Eurasia.

(C) 

Explain ONE  way in which  the transfer of  crops and/or domesticated animals during the  
Columbian  Exchange affected the environment.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The spread of European agricultural techniques led to deforestation in some regions of 

the Americas. 

•  The spread of Eurasian grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep, led to overgrazing in 

some regions. 

•  The Columbian exchange allowed the spread of invasive species, such as rats and 

rabbits, which altered ecosystems. 

•  Emphasis on cash crop agriculture (monoculture) decreased biodiversity and led to soil 

exhaustion.

Short Answer Question 3 

Overview 

The responses to this question were expected to demonstrate understanding of the Columbian 
Exchange by identifying technological developments that caused or contributed to the trade network 
that was established. Part B required responses to identify a benefit of the transfer of crops and/or 
domesticated animals for the populations of people involved. Part C asked for an explanation of how 
the transfer of crops and/or animals would impact the environment. 

Sample: 3A 
Score:  3  

a) The response earned 1 point by identifying the compass as a technological innovation that 
contributed to the Columbian Exchange. 

b) The response earned 1 point by identifying how the transfer of potatoes to Europe led to increased 
population. 

c) The response earned 1 point by explaining how plantation agricultural techniques resulted in soil 
deterioration and trees being cut down. 

Sample: 3B 
Score:  2  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the astrolabe as a technological development that 
contributed to the Columbian Exchange. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying “New World crops” in Europe “reducing death by 
starvation.” 

c) The response did not earn the point as it does not explain an effect of potatoes on the 
environment. 

Sample: 3C 
Score:  1  

a) The response did not earn the point because “refrigeration” did not directly contribute to the 
Columbian Exchange. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it correctly identifies “wheat and maize” as crops that 
benefitted the population by allowing people “to live healthier lives, therefore, living longer.” 

c) The response did not earn the point because it does not explain how the horse affected the 
environment.
