in which Muslim leaders confronted and/or defined their nationalist sentiments.   

0–7 Points 

1 Point

There are six documents. Students must use five or six documents. An essay  
may NOT simply list numbers of documents. 

1 Point 

3.  Understands the basic meaning of the documents cited in the essay. 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
Students must exhibit understanding of the basic meaning of at least four documents.   

1 Point 

4.  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from documents. 

Students must support thesis utilizing at least three documents by including why  
a document is significant or how it supports their thesis (analysis that displays a 
deeper grasp of the document). 

5.  Analyzes point of view. 

Students must include analysis of the author’s point of view in at least one document.  
•  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular  
opinion OR what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

1 Point 

1 Point 

•  Students must move beyond mere description of that individual by considering  

and explaining the tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended  
audience, and/or how the intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document. 

6.  Analyzes the documents by grouping them in at least two appropriate ways.  1 Point 

Sample groupings include: 

•  Anti-Western colonialism (Documents 2 and 4)

•  Role of education (Documents 1 and 6) 

7.  Identifies one type of appropriate additional document. 

1 Point 

Students must identify an additional document or type of document and explain why  
that document is appropriate for their argument. The additional document must provide  
a perspective other than those found in the documents AND offer an explanation as  
to what this additional document would add to the analysis.  

Common examples of this are: nonelite, female, or non-Muslim perspectives to demonstrate 
a degree of contrast with the elite male Muslim documents.

Question 3—Comparative 

BASIC CORE (competence): 

0–6 Points 

1.  Has acceptable thesis. 

1 Point 

The thesis must be stated directly and located at the beginning or end of the essay.   
It may not be split. Two topic sentences of two separate paragraphs do not make a thesis. 

There must be some minimal qualification of both differences and similarities to be 
an acceptable thesis. “There were economic similarities but political differences” 
is minimally acceptable; “There were similarities and differences” is not acceptable. 

2.  Addresses all parts of the question.    

To earn 2 points, students must acknowledge the task of analyzing four categories 
(political and economic effects on two regions). 

2 Points 

To earn 1 point, students must acknowledge TWO or THREE categories of analysis. 

(1 Point) 

No points are earned for acknowledging only one of the four categories. 

3.  Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence.  

To earn 2 points, students must present FOUR or more correct relevant  
pieces of information (historical examples). 

2 Points 

To earn 1 point, students must use TWO or THREE correct/relevant examples. 

(1 Point) 

Evidence of deliberate changes in social, cultural, or religious policies can be 
counted as political effects (i.e., these changes were consequences of political policy). 

One piece of evidence can be used for two regions and count for evidence in each region,  
if it is specifically explained for each region. (For example, “Reinvigoration of the Silk Roads 
benefited the economies of both X and Y regions by doing a in X and by doing b in Y.”) 

If there was no acceptable thesis, evidence must be relevant to the task. 

4.  Makes at least TWO relevant, direct comparisons among or between societies. 1 Point 

Students must make at least TWO direct, explicit comparisons or contrasts between  
the two regions to earn this point. One comparison must be political and the other  
must be economic. 

The comparisons must be distinct from the thesis. No double bonuses: For example, 
“There were economic similarities and political differences” cannot count for both  
the thesis point and the direct comparison point. 

Mere parallel construction is not enough to earn this point. 

Comparisons must be relevant and on task.
