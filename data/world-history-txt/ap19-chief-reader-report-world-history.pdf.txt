Question #1 

Task: Short Answer 
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Nomads and Cultural Exchange 
Mean Score: 1.10 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were prompted to interpret an argument from a secondary source and to 
identify or explain examples of cultural exchange between nomads and non-nomads that occurred before 1450, which 
could be religious, linguistic, or technological in nature. In addition, students were to identify one development that 
changed the role of Central Asian nomads in cross-regional exchanges in the period 1450–1750 C.E., typically 
expressed as a consequence of improvements in maritime technology and trade that diminished the role of nomads. 
Lastly, students were to explain one cross-cultural exchange before 1450 that would challenge the statement in the last 
sentence of the passage, which claims that pastoral nomads were the chief instigators and promoters of exchange 
between East and West before 1450. The question addressed Key Concepts 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1 in the AP World History 
Curriculum Framework, the historical reasoning skill of Contextualization, and the disciplinary practice of Analyzing 
Historical Evidence (secondary sources). 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question dealt directly with regional interaction and cultural exchanges, so it tied well to the content of the course. 
Students provided successful examples of cultural exchanges specifically nomadic societies such as the Mongols, 
Bantu, Huns, and Indo-Europeans as well as the Silk Roads as an example of cultural exchange that included the 
spread of religions such as Buddhism, Christianity, or Islam. The second part of the question required students to 
identify how the role of nomads in Central Asia changed in the period 1450–1750 C.E., and to connect the decline of 
nomadic agency to larger early modern processes in the course, such as the rise of gunpowder empires or the impact 
of maritime trade. Students struggled with the last part of the question as many struggled to challenge the idea that 
nomads were the only means of cultural exchange. The best responses included examples of non-nomadic agency in 
the spread of religions like Islam or Christianity the spread of specific technologies like the compass or papermaking, 
the influence of Alexander the Great in spreading Hellenistic Greek culture to other societies, or the cultural impact of 
merchants or missionaries. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The SAQ addressed two different time periods, which intensified student errors in terms of chronology. Students 
continued to provide evidence and examples that were outside the specified time period. In part a, some students 
misunderstood substantive concepts and terms such as “culture” (e.g., addressing instead disease and military tactics), 
and “nomad” (e.g., discussing non-nomadic societies such as such as the Phoenicians or Polynesians). Students often 
identified a correct nomadic or non-nomadic society but did not always provide a valid exchange, such as a valid example 
of religious or technological diffusion. In part b many students could not provide a development that changed the role of 
nomads in the early modern period. Instead students wrote about the continued expansion of the Silk Roads, the Mongol 
Empire, or the impact of the Industrial Revolution, all of which are outside of the time period. Students had a difficult time 
dealing with parts a and c in time periods before 1450, and then having to address the period 1450–1750 in part b. 
Students overall seemed to struggle with the term “assertion” in part c as many responses did not address how nomads 
were not the only means of cultural exchange. Students did not understand the need to mention other examples of cross-
cultural exchange that did not include nomads, and responses often misinterpreted the prompt to discuss a negative 
exchange initiated by nomads rather than a non-nomadic society initiating cultural exchange. Again, students also made 
chronological mistakes referring to the gunpowder empires, the Columbian Exchange, or the colonization of the Americas 
in a prompt designated before 1450.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“During 1450 to 1750 the creation of 
the Mongol Empire changed the role 
of nomads in cultural exchange. 
Before the Mongols, nomads acted as 
traders who spread trade and culture 
along routes, but this changed during 
the Mongol Empire, nomads became 
the protectors who patrolled the trade 
routes to keep them safe.” (The 
response is outside the time period of 
part b.) 

“One cross cultural exchange that 
would challenge the assertion of the 
last sentence of the passage 
concerning the nomads’ role in cross 
regional exchange before 1450 is the 
exchange between the Mongols 
becoming an empire and China. 
While the Mongols were nomads they 
had aggressively risen up to start 
conquering the land in around 1200 
C.E. This showed them as a violent 
and hostile people which at first did 
nothing for the exchange of culture.” 
(The response is arguing a negative 
impact of the Mongols rather than 
challenging the role of the nomads in 
cultural exchange according to the 
passage.) 

• 

• 

“One development that changed the role 
that Central Asian Nomads played in cross 
regional exchanges from the period 1450–
1750 C.E. as described in the passage was 
the development of maritime technology 
because new modes of transportation 
across the ocean using boats and 
knowledge of monsoon winds allowed 
countries to trade and exchange ideas and 
goods across regions with less overland 
use, which diminished the importance of 
central Asian nomads in exchanging goods 
and ideas and cultures overland. An 
example of this includes European maritime 
empires such as Britain and Portugal who 
navigated to Asia on sea in order to trade at 
trading posts. This sufficiently decreased 
central Asian nomads’ need to exchange 
goods along the Silk Road from Europe to 
Asia.” (The response includes a reference to 
maritime technology and the monsoon winds 
and mentions maritime European powers, all 
of which are developments that changed the 
role of Central Asian nomads.) 

“One cross-cultural exchange that would 
challenge the assertion in the last sentence 
of the passage concerning the nomads’ role 
in cross regional exchanges before 1450 is 
the spread of religion. During the period 
before 1450, religions such as Islam, 
Buddhism, and Christianity spread along 
major trade routes, such as the Silk Road. 
The spread of these religions was facilitated 
by merchants and missionaries, not 
nomads. Therefore, nomads were not sole 
facilitators of cross regional exchanges 
before 1450.” (The response includes 
reference to merchants and missionaries 
spreading religions that challenge the 
assertion in the passage that nomads were 
the chief promoters of cultural exchange 
between East and West.)

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Students need practice reading and analyzing secondary sources. Teachers should continue to focus instruction on 
periodization because students often provided historically accurate examples that were outside the proper time period 
of the prompt. Common mistakes made by students included conceptual misunderstanding of the difference between 
nomads and non-nomads and a lack of specificity in reference to changes in the nomads’ role in cross-regional 
exchange. Teachers should work to ensure that students have an understanding of the substantive concepts and 
global processes that are included in the AP World History course. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

• 

A rich new collection of resources is available to teachers for the 2019 school year that includes newly created 
formative and summative assessment items for every unit of the course and that represent each of the types of 
questions on the AP Exam. This includes SAQ practice questions for teachers to use as formative assessment 
pieces beginning with scaffolded questions that represent what students are ready for at the beginning of the 
school year and that represent an increased challenge as teachers progress through the course.  

• Teachers will find lessons on teaching the historical skill of secondary source analysis in the online modules, a 
link to which is found on AP Central and on AP Classroom. The modules include examples of secondary source 
analysis SAQs connected to different specific content areas. The modules contain lessons that address analyzing 
historical evidence, videos explaining instruction for this skill, and examples of assessments and student 
responses for tasks whose skill focus is analysis of historical evidence. 

• The Teaching and Assessing Modules also contain resources focused specifically on scoring responses that 

include secondary source analysis using the AP World history scoring rubric. The focus on assessment found in 
the online modules, for example, offers insight into how to address assessing source analysis. This includes 
examples and commentary on what earned points and what did not for tasks whose primary focus is source 
analysis.

Question #2 

Task: Short Answer 
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Life Expectancy at Birth Graph 
Mean Score: 1.49 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 
For this short-answer question, students were expected to analyze the data in the chart to identify global economic 
differences between countries and identify a factor that might account for low life expectancy at birth in some of the 
countries displayed on the chart. Furthermore, students needed to explain how longer life expectancy in some 
countries has led to political, social, or economic challenges. Students were expected to demonstrate the ability to 
analyze data and the understanding of the relationship between the global economy in the late twentieth century and 
shifting demographic, political, and social trends. The question addressed Key Concepts 6.1 and 6.3 in the AP World 
History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of Comparison and Causation. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Most students responded to this SAQ from a Human Geography perspective with less understanding of the appropriate 
historical content. The best responses made use of the chart and their knowledge of history to show how industrialization 
and imperialism promoted economic growth in some countries, while leaving other countries impoverished and without 
the infrastructure needed to provide adequate care for their citizens. Strong responses to challenges presented by longer 
life expectancy in some countries often drew from an understanding of the economic dependency ratio within those 
countries and the economic and political challenges of governments committed to providing social welfare programs.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

This SAQ largely addressed the late 20th century and some students had inadequate knowledge of this time period. 
Moreover, many students struggled with periodization. Some students wrote about the Industrial Revolutions and the 
social and economic challenges experienced as a result of increasing urbanization associated with the 19th century. 
Students also struggled to specifically identify challenges of the 21st century in parts b and b. Many responses provided 
generalizations that then required specific qualification to meet the scoring standard. In addition, students did not always 
connect longer life expectancy to a new political, economic, or social problem. Students commonly cited the problem of 
longer life expectancy in part c to be overpopulation but did not provide further qualification or explanation.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“When people live longer it can cause 
political problems because the older 
generation usually doesn’t want 
change and wants to keep old 
practices in order while the younger 
generation wants change and new 
political leaders. This can cause 
political instability.” (The response 
identifies a perceived political 
ideological gap between young and old 
generations without identifying a new 
problem specific to the 20th century.) 

“One similarity that might account for 
the low life expectancies would be the 
technological developments. In 
countries such as South Africa or 
Swaziland, industrialization is a new 
concept, and is jut now beginning to 
happen. None of these countries have 
advanced enough to sustain large 
populations, especially after the 
technological support of the 
colonization of the Europeans.” (The 
response identifies a lack of 
industrialization as a cause for lower 
life expectancy, but without further 
qualification to differentiate it from 
economic production (GDP).) 

• 

• 

“With longer life expectancies, there is a 
larger age group to account for. Issues 
regarding elderly are prevalent in countries 
such as the United States. For instance, 
Social Security and Medicaid are running 
out of funding and cannot wholly cover 
many households, leaving a great 
population of elderly without aid.” (The 
response correctly explains the economic 
strain the government and taxpayers of the 
U.S. face as they support, with Social Security 
and Medicaid, an increasing elderly 
population.) 

“One similarity that might account for low 
life expectancies is the lack of western 
medicine in countries. Countries with low 
life expectancies, such as Mozambique, 
Swaziland, and South Africa are African 
countries that don’t have a lot of access to 
western innovations. This includes new 
medical technologies, such as vaccinations, 
that can increase life expectancy.” (The 
response identifies the lack of access to 
medicine and vaccines as accounting for low 
life expectancy in some African countries.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

It is important for students to be able to recognize which skill is being required by the prompt and to be explicit in 
applying that skill in their response. Teachers could focus on reinforcing how to effectively make direct comparisons, 
using specific historical context. Additionally, students would benefit from more clarity of—and practice with—SAQ skill 
questions that require an explanation, as opposed to simply identification. Students were able to make identifications in 
part c but struggled to provide clear explanations.  

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question?

Question #3 

Task: Short Answer 

Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Changes and Continuities of 
the Neolithic Revolution  
Mean Score: 1.42 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify changes and continuities in subsistence patterns in 
Eurasian societies both before and after the Neolithic Revolution. Students first had to identify a subsistence pattern 
pre-dating the Neolithic Revolution that continued in the period circa 10,000 B.C.E. to 3,000 B.C.E. Next, students had 
to identify one way in which the Neolithic Revolution changed Eurasian subsistence patterns in the same period. 
Lastly, students had to explain how these changes in subsistence patterns altered a political or social structure in 
Eurasian society. The question addressed Key Concepts 1.1 and 1.2 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework 
and the historical reasoning skill of Continuity and Change. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Most students were able to demonstrate their knowledge of the development of agriculture and the changes in both 
subsistence and migration patterns that come with the adoption of sedentary lifestyles. Students generally understood 
how agricultural surpluses impacted job specialization and changing gender roles in societies. Many students understood 
that hunting and gathering practices continued among some nomadic peoples in Asia after the development of 
agriculture. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Students struggled with interpreting the phrase “subsistence patterns.” Many students only understood that phrase in 
the context of subsistence agriculture and, therefore, had trouble placing nomadic pastoralism both before and after 
the Neolithic Revolution. Many students thought that subsistence agriculture was always around and simply improved 
upon with better tools in the Neolithic era based on their knowledge that Neolithic means “New Stone Age.” Their 
knowledge of the pre-Neolithic era was also limited to migratory patterns. Frequently, students only discussed 
migration rather than addressing the hunting and foraging lifestyles of pre-Neolithic peoples in relation to a 
subsistence pattern. Students were also not adept at fully explaining how agriculture or pastoralism altered social or 
political patterns. They could identify that classes developed or that governments formed in the Neolithic era, but many 
struggled to explain the role of surplus agriculture and job specialization in relationship to the development of social 
and political hierarchies.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“Nomadic ways of life before the Neolithic 
Revolution continued with nomads who didn’t 
settle in agricultural communities.” (The 
response identifies a migration pattern rather 
than a subsistence pattern.) 

“Farming creates different jobs in civilizations. 
Some people farm, while others hunt.” (The 
response identifies the general impact of 
agriculture on economic change and touches 
upon specialization. However, the response does 
not accurately or sufficiently explain how 
economic change caused by the development of 
agriculture altered political or social structures in 
Eurasian societies.) 

• 

• 

“Nomadic hunter-gather societies continued to exist 
after the development of agriculture foraging for both 
wild grains and berries and hunting game during the 
Neolithic era.” (The response accurately demonstrates a 
continuity in pre-Neolithic subsistence patterns that 
extended into the Neolithic era.) 

“Farming surpluses allow sedentary communities to 
develop job specialization as not everyone has to be 
engaged in food production. Due to this, some jobs 
become more valued than others. This creates social 
hierarchies and classes that grow increasingly different 
in power over time.” (The response explains how 
agricultural surplus changes job patterns and then how 
these economic changes impact social structures.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should provide some context for the Neolithic Revolution and the development of sedentary agricultural 
communities and later civilizations by introducing and emphasizing the relationship between pre-Neolithic migratory 
patterns and subsistence hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Many students believe that “nomadism” before agriculture involves 
herding domesticated animals and, therefore, associate nomadic societies after the ancient period as continuing the 
traditions of peoples from before the formation of sedentary civilizations. Pastoralism is not seen as the twin development 
of the Neolithic Revolution. A surplus of agricultural produce and a surplus of herd animals created similar alterations to 
political and social structures. This fact could help students see nomadic pastoralists as also “civilized” people with 
social and political hierarchies. The traditional trope and juxtaposition of “civilized” sedentary societies with “barbarian” 
nomads could then be removed from explanations of the relationship between later pastoralists like the Mongols and 
sedentary empires like the Song. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

• 

Teachers will find lessons on teaching the historical reasoning process of continuity and change over time in the 
classroom resources found on AP Central and in AP Classroom. Some of these resources focus on the reasoning 
process of continuity and change and provide specific lessons that address continuity and change, videos 
explaining continuity and change in conjunction with course content and examples of assessments and student 
responses for tasks whose skill focus is continuity and change.

Question #4 

Task: Short Answer 

Max. Points: 3  

Topic: New Elites in the period 1750–
1900 
Mean Score: 1.00 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify economic changes that led to the formation of new 
elites in the period 1750–1900. Students were also expected to explain how the traditional elites, despite economic 
change, remained in power in the period 1750–1900. Finally, students were expected to explain how the formation of 
the new elites led to the emergence of a new ideology in the period 1750–1900. The question addressed Key Concepts 
5.1 and 5.2 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of Contextualization, 
Causation, and Continuity and Change. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

•  Students were generally able to identify capitalism and industrialization as the economic 

changes that led to the formation of new elites in the period 1750–1900. Many responses did a 
good job in explaining how traditional elites such as monarchs and aristocrats remained in 
power by taking advantage of their existing wealth and political status in the period 1750–
1900. In addition, many students demonstrated appropriate understanding of how economic 
changes facilitated the formation of new elites that led to the emergence of socialist ideology. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

•  Many students struggled with periodization as they inaccurately identified economic changes and ideologies that 

took place outside of the time period. Some responses inaccurately cited the Columbian Exchange and the 
development of the transatlantic slave trade as economic changes. Students also misidentified the Enlightenment 
and Fascism as ideologies that developed in the period 1750–1900. Some students misunderstood the term 
“elite,” as they referred to countries as elites rather than individuals or social groups.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“However, countries such as China 
were still powerful despite closing off 
from the rest of the world. Their 
sense of nationalism gave them an 
advantage that other countries didn't 
have.” (The response tries to explain 
why a country, rather than a group of 
people, retained its power despite 
economic change. Even if the claim 
made in the response was accurate, the 
response would not have addressed the 
prompt.) 

“Enlightenment ideas grew 
immensely as new people came into 
power.” (the response does not specify 
an ideology that emerged from the 
Enlightement, such as nationalism. In 
addition, the response provides an 
identification rather than an 
explanation.)  

• 

• 

“Industrialization led to the formation of 
new elites on the global level. Despite 
economic change, traditional elites, like 
aristocrats, still maintained power because 
they were largely unaffected by this new 
economic order. Those with social status 
derived it through family lineage, which 
didn't conflict with economic change. Elites 
still had control over politics and 
government, and utilized their connections 
to those in control to ensure that their way 
of life would not come to an end.” (The 
response explains the factors that allowed 
aristocrats to maintain their power despite 
economic change.) 

“The formation of elites thanks to 
industrialization and capitalism i.e. industry 
barons, prompted the emergence of 
communism and socialism. These 
ideologies were a response to the 
inequalities propagated by the capitalist-
industrialist system, in which workers 
slaved for meager wages and did not share 
in the wealth they were exploited for. Ideas 
like socialism and communism promoted 
economic and social equality between the 
classes, an idea that appealed to many in 
the poorer end of society.” (The response 
explains how socialism and communism 
emerged in response to economic inequalities 
caused by industrialization.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

•  Teachers should integrate skill-building exercises with student development of content knowledge. Many 
students knew correct information about industrialization but were unable to appropriately deploy that 
historical knowledge relative to the question asked and the skill associated. When teaching contextualization, 
teachers should differentiate between evidence and context. Teachers should also conclude units by having 
students brainstorm about how the events and themes they have covered will potentially inform developments 
in the next time period. Teachers should emphasize chronology and periodization over dates to ensure 
students have a mastery of the general “flow” of history. Teachers should distribute a set of events and 
developments and have students put them in proper chronological order, while also being attentive to how they 
are associated with the specific themes of the AP World History course. Students also need to practice making 
specific connections between events and developments to avoid overgeneralizing about change.

Question #1 

Task: Document Based 
Question 
Max. Points: 7 

Topic: The Portuguese and Indian 
Ocean Trade  
Mean Score: 2.28 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
evidence within historical documents. This Document-Based Question (DBQ) asked students to evaluate the 
extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century. The 
question addressed Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of the AP World History Course Framework, notably the 
early modern expansion of transoceanic voyaging and the changes brought to Indian Ocean trading networks 
with the establishment of a Portuguese trading-post empire. The question also addressed the use of 
mercantilist practices and armed trade for profit and for the reinforcement of state power, as well as 
fluctuations in the relative political and economic power of elite groups. The question provided opportunities 
for students to demonstrate all four of the historical reasoning skills, with a central focus on the skill of 
explaining Continuity and Change over Time. Responses were also expected to demonstrate the disciplinary 
practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence (primary sources) and Argument Development. The six text-based 
documents provided evidence of trade relationships as interpreted by local Malabar Coast residents 
(merchants and scholars), as viewed from a European perspective (Portuguese government officials as well as 
a private trader), and as seen by a Sumatran ruler. The final document was an image of an artifact illustrating 
the Portuguese luxury-goods trade in the Indian Ocean. Responses were expected to evaluate these various 
primary sources, to add additional relevant historical detail, and to utilize the pieces of evidence singly and in 
combination to support and qualify a historical argument, as well as to contextualize that argument within broader 
historical developments. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students were generally able to identify at least one significant impact of the arrival of the Portuguese on maritime 
trading patterns in the Indian Ocean and that allowed many responses to earn the thesis point. Students also often 
exhibited knowledge of both Indian Ocean and broader transoceanic patterns of trade and empire-building in the early 
modern period, such as Iberian Atlantic conquests and the Portuguese model of trading-post empire.  

Most responses successfully described historically relevant information from at least three documents, although a 
significant portion of the responses did not expand their use of these documents beyond a simple description. Many 
students were able to use at least six of the documents as evidence in support of claims or arguments about the 
Portuguese impact in the Indian Ocean. Responses often used topic sentences to link the relevant information from the 
documents to a historically defensible argument. And although a large minority of responses treated each document 
separately, many responses used multiple documents in pairings or groupings to collaborate evidence in support of a 
claim or an argument. Notably, documents 1 and 2 (both about Portuguese displacement of Muslim traders in and near 
Calicut) were frequently used together, as were documents 4 and 5 (both about Portuguese extortion and militarization of 
trade). 

Credit for Evidence Beyond the Documents was relatively rarely given, as many responses failed to mention additional 
information, used vague generalities without specific detail, or mentioned historically accurate facts without using them 
to extend a claim or argument about the impact of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean. Sourcing of the documents was 
also relatively rare, as many responses omitted any attempt to evaluate credibility, limitations, point of view, or similar 
characteristics of the documents. Many of those who attempted to source a minimum of three documents limited their 
discussion to summaries or repetition of the source attribution information provided in the question without identifying 
the relevance of that information to authorial point-of-view or purpose, audience, or historical context. Many responses 
included a request for an additional document, seemingly unaware that the requirement to do so is no longer part of the 
task for the Document-Based Question. Finally, very few responses were able to demonstrate a complex understanding 
as part of the argument, which is to be expected given the nature of the sophisticated thinking required. Of the responses

that did earn the point for complex understanding, most did so by putting the documents in conversation with each other 
and making their argument with a thorough evidentiary use of the documents or relating the documents to each other 
through collaboration or qualification. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Though students did seem to understand that the Portuguese gained control, many students did not show an awareness 
of resistance or negotiation or agency of other historical actors mentioned in the documents, such as the Malabar Coast 
traders, Ottoman forces, or Indonesian states. Many students had difficulty with various aspects of Document 3 (the 
Portuguese recommendation against free trade with the Ottoman Empire); many misread it as supporting free trade, and 
many others simply did not seem to understand the Ottoman relationship to the Indian Ocean. Similar difficulties affected 
students’ interpretation of Document 6 (the Venetian commentary on spices); some misunderstood the economic 
reasoning that led suppliers to provide low-quality products to Portugal, and almost none exhibited understanding of the 
trade-intermediary role played by Middle Eastern and Venetian merchants. Many students still seem confused about the 
relevance and level of detail expected when discussing evidence beyond the documents or in sourcing the documents. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•

• 

“After reaching the Indian Ocean 
with its merchants, Portugal came in 
and took over the spice trade in 
Calicut, totally driving all the other 
merchants out.” (The attempted 
document analysis ignores evidence 
from the documents which leads it to 
make an oversimplified and historically 
inaccurate claim.) 

“The historian al Sageer wrote about 
Portugal’s takeover of trade in his 
‘address to southern Indian Muslims’ 
around 1570. His intended audience 
was Muslims in southern India.” (The 
attempt at document merely restates 
parts of the source attribution for 
Document 5 that is provided in the 
question.) 

“Although Portugal gained significant 
power at Calicut and other trade ports 
around the Indian Ocean, earlier groups of 
Hindu and Muslim merchants also 
continued to operate in the area.” (The 
statement successfully uses evidence from the 
documents to support an argument relevant to 
the prompt.) 

“As a Muslim himself, al Sageer might 
understandably be inclined to cast the 
Catholic Portuguese in a more negative 
light, perhaps trying to build Indian unity 
and resistance in the face of increasing 
European presence.” (The statement 
effectively analyzes the sourcing of Document 
5, explaining how the author’s point of view 
and/or purpose may have influenced his 
arguments in the document.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Many students would benefit from repetitive practice explicitly linking evidence within a document to an argument or 
claim. Even a mechanical or formulaic structure will help to build the habit of actually using the document as evidence of 
a claim, rather than simply summarizing it. 

Similarly, more advanced students who can already deploy documentary evidence for the purpose of developing and 
substantiating an argument should practice sourcing analysis, with particular emphasis linking the identification of the 
audience and purpose of a document to evaluating the relevance or credibility of the document’s claims or arguments.

One other simple practice that could be reinforced for all levels of student is to be certain to include all 7 documents in the 
course of the response. Too many students are writing relatively effective essays but neglecting one or two pieces of 
evidence so that they risk failing to show their true capabilities. 

The most advanced students would probably do best to practice building more complex arguments. Thesis-writing 
exercises that use the phrasing “to what extent” will help students gain the habit of using precisely nuanced and qualified 
arguments. Any causation discussion should insist that students identify two or more causes for any historical 
development whenever possible, to help develop the sophisticated and divergent thinking that is at the heart of complex 
understanding. Documents should be addressed within the student’s response in relation to their collaboration, 
qualification or contradiction of specific claims within the overall argument. Students should practice organizing their 
essays matching documents to claims as opposed to addressing each document in the order presented on the exam.

Question #2 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: Empires and Increasing Trade, 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 
Mean Score: 1.61 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the agency and role of 
empires and empire-building in the increase in trade from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. The question addressed Key 
Concepts 2.3.I, 2.3.II, and 2.3.III of the AP World History Curriculum Framework. Students were expected to 
address the means by which states facilitated the expansion of trade through policies, administration, 
infrastructure development, and the provision of security. Responses were to address one or more specific 
empires in the period. The question tested students’ ability to utilize multiple historical reasoning skills and 
disciplinary practices, specifically Argument Development, Contextualization, and Causation. While the 
question was focused upon causation, there were successful student responses that compared the roles that 
various rising empires played in increasing trade. There were also opportunities for responses to discuss 
changes and continuities over time regarding the role of empires in increasing trade. The question was broadly 
constructed geographically and was open to multiple answers drawn from various regions and empires within the 
Classical Era. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students with knowledge of the appropriate periodization performed well on this question. This question drew from 
content clearly outlined in the course description and allowed students to discuss any of the Classical empires. Many 
students were able to identify a variety of imperial factors that facilitated trade with reference to specific empires. These 
factors included the provision of imperial security for trade (e.g. the Han Empire providing security along parts of the Silk 
Roads), state investment in infrastructure (e.g. Roman roads), and the state creation of uniform currencies, weights and 
measures, and language. Moreover, many students were able to explain the connection between state action and 
commercial expansion. However, in some cases, students did not present an appropriate level of specificity and instead 
offered claims that were overly generalized. For example, a number of responses discussed the role of roads in 
stimulating economic development, but without reference to a specific empire. Although a significant portion of the 
responses attempted to set their arguments in a historical context, many such efforts lacked specificity or a clear 
connection to the prompt. Most successful responses established contextualization either by addressing the rise of a 
specific empire or by discussing non-state factors that also contributed to trade within or prior to the Classical Period. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Many students struggled to provide specific content that was relevant to the time period indicated in the prompt. Failure 
to identify specific empires in the Classical period was common. Quite a number of responses focused on out-of-period 
examples (e.g. the Mongol Empire or various Islamic empires and/or caliphates. Many responses also inverted the task in 
the prompt and wrote about the effects of trade on empires (rather than about the effects of empires on trade). Students 
frequently discussed course themes or historical that were not directly relevant to the prompt, specifically, religious and 
cultural diffusion and demographic movements along trade routes.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

• 

• 

“In the Classical era when nomadic 
groups started to have agriculture 
instead [of] hunting and gathering, 
people became sedentary and created 
civilizations that became empires, 
therefore in the period 600 B.C.E. to 
600 C.E. the rise of large scale 
empires led to increases in region[al] 
and transregional trade.” (The 
attempted contextualization is too 
general and its connection to the 
prompt is too tenuous.). 

“As ideas spread, religions blended, 
philosophies were made. In a huge 
empire like [R]ome, the philosophers 
had philosophies coming from all 
sorts of different ideas and places. 
Religions changed and blended like 
Christianity, which came from 
Judaism and changed into what we 
know today, people following the 
preachings and teachings of the 
[B]ible.” (The attempt to offer evidence 
pertains to cultural processes and is 
not clearly linked to economic 
exchanges or increases in trade.) 

“The Roman Republic would soon wage 
war against Carthage in a series of conflicts 
called the Punic Wars. The conquest of 
Carthage granted the Romans full control of 
Sicily and lands in Spain and North Africa. 
These important Mediterranean holdings 
allowed for an ever-growing monopoly of 
Roman trade in the region.” (Successfully 
places the argument about the role of Roman 
territorial expansion on promoting trade in an 
appropriate historical context.) 

“Another change that increased trade was 
the creation of coins in Persia. Persian coins 
made trade much easier because, instead of 
bartering, one could fairly exchange goods 
for a certain price. This change increased 
trade because it made it safer to exchange 
goods at a fair rate. Previous, as far back as 
the Neolithic transition, trade had been 
carried out through bartering, giving one 
good for another. Currency made the 
exchange much more efficient and simpler, 
therefore increasing trade due to the 
[policies of] the Roman and Persian 
empires.” (Offers specific evidence and uses it 
to support an argument directly relevant to the 
prompt - focus on economic developments 
and increases in trade.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should emphasize location, chronology and periodization when covering content. Teachers need to use relevant 
instructional strategies for teaching correct chronology and periodization and have student practice identifying and 
categorizing events, perhaps through use of timelines (illustrated, electronic or physical). Teachers should spend time 
increasing students’ awareness of how the AP World History themes intersect with one another as opposed to teaching 
them individually without interaction. In addition, students should have multiple opportunities to practice deconstructing 
a prompt. This is valuable, as the AP Histories’ prompts may require a discussion of the relationship between different 
historical reasoning skills as opposed to focusing on one skill. In addition to content, students should be taught to employ 
the vocabulary needed in writing essays for each type of historical reasoning skill (cause, effect, change, continuity, 
similarities, differences, etc.). Teachers need to provide opportunities for students to write practice essays with attention 
given towards writing with clarity. Practice complexity as often as possible, possibly explaining it as an extension of the 
topic in “another way, another view, or another time.”

Question #3 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: Technology and Economic 
Growth, 600 C.E. to 1400 C.E. 
Mean Score: 1.36 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the technological 
developments in the years 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. that impacted economic growth. The question addressed Key 
Concepts 3.1.I, 3.3.II, and 3.3.III from the AP World History Curriculum Framework. The question primarily 
tested students’ ability to deploy the historical reasoning skills of Causation and Contextualization and the 
history disciplinary practice of Argument Development. Students were not, however, limited to using the skill 
of causation as there were opportunities to demonstrate historical understanding by comparing the relative 
impacts of a variety of technological developments in different areas (e.g., navigational technologies compared 
to overland travel technologies) or technological developments in different regions (e.g., the impact of 
technological developments in China compared to the impact of technological developments in Europe). The 
question was open geographically to allow responses from multiple areas, with a specific chronological tie to 
the Post-Classical Era. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

While many students performed well on this question, others struggled to identify and use historical evidence relevant 
to the chronological framework of 600 C.E.–1450 C.E. Students who chose Question 3 overwhelmingly developed 
essays that addressed navigational and transportation technologies as their key focus, and the majority of the essays 
focused on the impact of these technologies on trade in the Indian Ocean or over land across Eurasia. Students were 
generally successful in creating thesis statements, despite the fact that some level of specificity was required beyond 
the simple umbrella terms of “economic innovations” or “maritime technologies.” Many responses identified specific 
technological innovations, including the compass, astrolabe, and lateen sails, as factors contributing to economic or 
commercial growth in this period. New financial, agricultural, or commercial practices such as the use of flying money 
or credit in China, the implementation of the three-field system, the impact of the horse collar in Europe, or the role of 
camel domestication and camel caravans in Sub-Saharan Africa were also frequently cited as evidence and were 
generally credited under a broad interpretation of the term “technological.” Students struggled slightly, however, with 
deploying their evidence to support claims or arguments (as opposed to merely stating or listing them). A significant 
minority of students were able to explain the impact of a specific technology upon trade within the appropriate time 
period and earned the Historical Reasoning point. However, the great majority of students struggled to earn the point 
for demonstrating historical complexity.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

Many responses discussed the importance of technology in general without connecting it to economics. Others 
struggled to provide accurate historical evidence from within the time period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E. A significant 
percentage of the responses, lured by the date of 1450 C.E., erroneously discussed the Columbian Exchange as an 
innovation that impacted economies in both the “New World” and the “Old World.” Unfortunately, this approach 
sometimes led to entire responses that addressed out-of-period material. Contextualization attempts were sometimes 
too vague or general, or lacked any relevant connection with the prompt. Many students simply made no attempt to 
contextualize either technological or economic developments within or before the period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E. Successful 
contextualization attempts often entailed explaining the development of specific trading communities or networks.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“Trade has always been an important 
part of human society. Trade not only 
helps goods spread throughout the 
world but it also helps with cultural 
diffusion and economic growth.” (The 
attempted contextualization is 
unsuccessful because of the lack of 
specificity.)  

“Following the voyage of Christopher 
Columbus, many new food 
innovations were introduced into the 
trade. New items like corn and 
potatoes were introduced to Europe 
and livestock was introduced to the 
Americas.” (The attempt to offer 
evidence is unsuccessful because it 
falls outside the time period specified in 
the prompt.) 

• 

• 

“At the start of the period 600 to 1450 C.E., 
the classical empires of world history such 
as Greece, Rome, and Persia collapsed, 
ushering in post-classical societies, 
however at the same time, trade routes 
throughout Eurasia flourished as the large 
scale empires had prompted and increased 
the use of profitable trade routes such as the 
Indian Ocean trade and the Silk Road.” 
(Successfully relates the historical 
background of the transition to post-classical 
states and societies to the topic of trade and 
trade routes.)  

“The compass, which came from China and 
allowed sailors to navigate, combined with 
the Lateen Sails which developed in the 
Indian Ocean and allowed ships to 
maneuver more easily were both important 
innovations. They allowed ship captains to 
plan their voyages more accurately, which 
allowed them to expand their trade base. 
Within a few short years of 1450 
Christopher Columbus and his men set out 
using the compass to try to find a shorter 
route to China and India for Spain’s trade.  
They weren’t successful, but did establish a 
new trade base in the Americas, all because 
of the compass.” (The evidence offered is 
correct for the time period specified in the 
prompt.)  

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

One of the biggest overarching issues observed is that students appear to learn information in an overly 
compartmentalized manner. They seem to focus on specific units of study, rather than developing an all-encompassing 
chronology of events with a concrete sense of the periodization that frames and organizes the AP World History 
course. As a result, while many students could articulate how technological innovations affected trade, they often did 
so with historical evidence and examples associated with a different time period than that specified in the prompt. One 
activity in the classroom that will address this problem is to use timelines throughout the year. Consider creating a 
large timeline in the classroom and have students add to it as the year progresses, or have students create and keep 
personal timelines with key major events aligned to the AP World History periodization scheme. The most important 
thing is to continually revisit the overall chronology to make sure students are aware of course periodization.

Question #4 

Task: Long Essay 
Question 
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: States Controlling Their 
Economies After 1900 
Mean Score: 2.16 

What were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? 

Responses were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the extent to which states in the twentieth 
and early twenty-first century controlled their economies. The question primarily addressed Key Concept 6.3.I 
(“The role of the state in the domestic economy varied, and new institutions of global association emerged and 
continued to develop throughout the century”). The question provided opportunities for students to 
demonstrate two distinct sets of historical thinking: lower-order (recall) and higher-order skills (analysis and 
argumentation). In addition, the question tested students’ mastery of the historical reasoning skills of 
Causation and Contextualization and the history disciplinary practice of Argument Development. Although the 
prompt did not explicitly target the historical thinking skill of Continuity and Change over Time, it offered 
students ample opportunities to address fundamental shifts in state-directed economic policy as motivated by 
such key events as the World Wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the development of international 
capitalism/neoliberalism, and the rise and fall of communism and fascism, as well as more recent 
developments such as economic globalization and the development of international organizations and blocs. 
Although responses were mostly expected to address twentieth-century developments, the prompt’s wording 
allowed coverage of content from the period after 2000 as well. Responses could develop an argument by 
demonstrating knowledge of a wide variety of economic models and theories, including communist central 
planning, laissez-faire capitalism, Keynesian economics, corporatist economic approaches in fascist states, etc. 
The question also provided opportunities for (though it did not require) responses to engage in comparing the effects 
of various types of economic policies pursued by states since 1900. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses 
integrate the skills required on this question? 

Responses generally demonstrated a strong understanding of the historical content related to the topic of state economic 
control after 1900. The vast majority of the responses focused on policies pursued by the U.S. and/or the Soviet Union 
(often explicitly comparing the two), while a large minority also discussed China (both under Mao and after the shift to 
market-oriented policies) and/or the economic policies of Nazi Germany. A minority of responses addressed the 
deregulation of state economies in the late 20th century or the development of mixed economies with public–private 
partnerships at various times over the century. Most responses contained a decent amount of specific historical evidence 
and, to a lesser extent, contextualization. Successful contextualization attempts often addressed the ideological origins 
(both pre- and post-1900) of economic policies informed by Capitalism, Communism, Fascism, Keynesianism, and 
neoliberalism. Relatively fewer responses demonstrated mastery of the higher-order disciplinary practice of Argument 
Development. Among those that did so, the most prevalent approaches included analysis of the causal factors for, and 
sometimes the effects of, such large, state-sponsored economic programs as the United States New Deal, the Soviet Five-
Year Plans, or the Chinese Great Leap Forward, among others. Some students were able to earn the Historical Reasoning 
point by explaining the origins or impacts of state regulation or deregulation upon the economy. The Complexity point 
proved to be much more difficult, as responses generally did not include enough supporting information to substantiate 
or extend these arguments.  

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this question? 

The most common misconception related to a fundamental misreading or misunderstanding of the question was namely 
in that the responses were about political—not economic—control by a state. Surprisingly, a number of responses seem 
to have interpreted the task as inquiring about the economic policies of individual U.S. states (e.g., New York, California, 
Colorado, etc.), a mistake which typically prevented such responses from earning high scores. Many responses included 
arguments relating to the successes and/or failures of a given economic system without connecting these arguments to 
state economic control. Additionally, some responses included value judgments on the efficacy of economic systems—
especially communism—in turn straying from the topic and avoiding a direct response to the prompt. Generally speaking,

the responses to the question did not reveal many gaps in student knowledge—except for a predictable number of 
misconceptions concerning the specific details of various economic programs and policies—but they did reveal a general 
tendency to focus on the U.S., China, and/or the Soviet Union. Such responses are understandable, given the dominance 
of these countries in the 20th century. However, many of the responses tended to present these nations as existing in a 
vacuum, with little international or transregional interaction with smaller nations.

“The USSR wished to control their

they did this through labor camps

historically accurate, the attempted

policies or state economic control.) 

“The United States was the main

and characterized by value judment, 
rather than a specific example or 
instance in which capitalism influenced 
U.S. economic policy.) 

“Both the Soviet Union and China employed 
massive violence and subjugation of 
peoples in order to support their 
economies.” (While minimal and generalized, 
the thesis statement makes a valid claim 
linking Soviet and Chinese state violence to 
economic consideration.) 

“In the United States … government 
intervention was required in order to bring 
Americans out of the Great Depression with 
Roosevelt’s ‘socialist’ New Deal.” (The 
statement offers a specific historical 
example/context in which the U.S. embraced 
economic intervention in order to counter the 
effects of the Great Depression.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer teachers to 
help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Students who answered this question were more successful on average than those who selected one of the other two 
LEQs. This is partly explained by the fact that the content is easier to remember as it is taught at the end of the AP 
World History course. In this sense, it behooves teachers to ensure that they pace their instruction so that the entirety 
of the 20th century is taught with the equivalent curricular depth and time as the rest of the units of the course. 
Teachers also need to ensure that students are required to not only identify and describe economic policies associated 
with specific states (or types of states), but they must also be able to explain the origins and impacts of these policies 
to earn the Historical Reasoning point. Students should also be more aware of the dynamic forces of change that were 
at play during the 20th century. Very few students were able to discuss or explain the changing nature of economic 
regulation across the 20th century as was the case in the relative deregulation of the economies of China, India, Russia 
and the U.S. Addressing and explaining the dynamic as opposed to static nature of economic policy in the 20th century 
was the clearest way for students to earn the Historical Complexity point.

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the content and skill(s) 
required on this question? 

• 

LEQ practice questions for teachers to use as formative assessment pieces are now available as part of the 
collection of new resources for teachers for the 2019 school year. The LEQ practice questions begin with 
scaffolded questions that represent what students are ready for at the beginning of the school year and then 
present an increased challenge as teachers progress through the course with their students over the course of the 
school year. These resources are available on AP Classroom and specific question types and topics can be 
specifically searched to identify the new collection of LEQ practice questions and the fully developed scoring 
guidelines that accompany each question.  

• Teachers will find lessons on teaching the reasoning process of causation in the classroom resources section of 
the World History page on AP Central. The modules contain specific lessons that address causation, videos 
explaining causation in conjunction with this period, and examples of assessments and student responses for 
tasks whose skill focus is causation.   

• Teachers will find example responses from this question on AP Central, along with specific commentary 

explaining why each point was or was not earned. 

• The Online Teacher Community is a good resource for teachers to seek additional feedback and support from 

peers by posting a question or comment in the discussion section, or by checking what resources have already 
been posted in the “resources” tab on the Online Teacher Community. 

• The instructional section of the AP World History Course and Exam Description offers another collection of 
resources for teachers that address each of the specific skills needed for the course. The section on page 182 
specifically addresses the skills required for LEQs and provides suggestions for instruction. This section is 
followed by a section that provides instructional suggestions for the reasoning processes.
