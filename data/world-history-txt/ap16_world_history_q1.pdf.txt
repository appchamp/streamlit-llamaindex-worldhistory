                       Question 1  

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1. Has acceptable thesis 

0-7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address at least two relationships between gender and politics in 
Latin America in the twentieth century plausibly drawn from the documents.   

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or specified in the 

conclusion of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple consecutive sentences. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count in any other category.  

2. Understands the basic meaning of documents  
•  Students must address all 10 of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate an understanding of the basic meaning of at least nine 

1 Point 

documents.  

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to a relationship between gender and politics.  

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without context 

does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document  

1-2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a relationship between gender and politics must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a relationship between gender and politics must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

4. Analyzes point of view in at least two documents 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents.  
•  Point of view explains why this individual might have this opinion or what feature 

1 Point 

informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description, perhaps by explaining a document’s 
tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion (or some combination of these). 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, but 

they must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing 
some plausible analysis of how or why.  

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying verbatim or only repeating 

information from the source line of the document.

2016 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

This question asked students to use the documents to analyze the relationships between gender and 
politics in twentieth-century Latin America. The question addressed Key Concept 6.3. of the AP World 
History Curriculum Framework (New Conceptualizations of Global Economy, Society, and Culture), 
specifically Section 6.3. III (People conceptualized society and culture in new ways: rights-based 
discourses challenged old assumptions about race, class, gender, and religion. In much of the world access 
to educations as well as participation in new political and professional roles, became more inclusive in 
terms of race, class, and gender). The 10 documents provided students with multiple opportunities to 
examine the intersection of the cultural concept of gender and the practice of politics in Latin America. 
The documents addressed themes such as the predominantly patriarchal nature of Latin American 
societies; the cultural expectations of politics as part of the male-dominated public sphere; the unfolding of 
debates over the question of women’s suffrage; the efforts of women to undertake direct political action in 
order to assert their rights or challenge cultural norms; and the impact of global ideologies such as 
socialism, communism, and feminism on the role of women in Latin American politics. As part of their 
responses, students also had to group the documents in at least three ways as well as analyze the authorial 
point of view of at least two documents of their choice. The selection of documents in the question 
provided students with multiple opportunities to earn the points for grouping and point-of-view analysis. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 9 

The thesis in the introductory paragraph earned 1 point. The essay addresses and demonstrates an 
understanding of all 10 documents and earned 1 point as a result. The essay earned 2 points as specific 
evidence is drawn from all 10 documents. The essay identifies five document groups, which earned 1 point 
for grouping the documents. The first group, consisting of Documents 2 and 3, is discussed on page 1. The 
second group, consisting of Documents 7, 8, 9, and 10, is discussed on pages 2–3. The third group, 
consisting of Documents 4 and 5, is discussed on pages 3–4. The fourth group, consisting of Documents 1 
and 6, is discussed at the bottom of page 4. The fifth group, consisting of Documents 2, 5, and 10, is 
discussed on page 5. The essay contains four instances of successful analysis of authorial point of view: for 
Document 2 (middle of page 1), Document 7 (middle of page 2), Document 4 (top of page 4), and Document 
1 (bottom of page 4). This earned the essay 1 point for point-of-view analysis. There is an additional 
attempt to analyze the point of view of Documents 5 and 10 (on page 5) by addressing their reliability as a 
group with Document 2, but the explanation provided is not sufficient, so these attempts were not counted 
towards the point-of-view analysis Basic Core point. There are three requests for additional documents 
near the end of the essay (bottom of page 5), which earned 1 point for additional document request. The 
first request — for a graph showing the percentages of women versus men in politics — is particularly well 
developed. In addition to earning all 7 points in the Basic Core, the essay earned 2 points in the Expanded 
Core for the multiple document groupings, the successful weaving of multiple instances of point-of-view 
analysis into the argument, and the inclusion of more than one additional document request. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6 

The thesis in the introductory paragraph earned 1 point. The essay addresses all 10 documents and 
demonstrates an understanding of the basic meaning of nine documents (Document 7 is misread), which 
earned 1 point. The essay earned 2 points as specific evidence is drawn from all 10 documents. The essay 
identifies three groups of documents, which earned 1 point for grouping the documents. All three 
document groups are explicitly identified in the second paragraph on page 1 and are then discussed 
individually in detail on the subsequent pages. The first group, consisting of Documents 1 and 6, is

discussed on pages 1–2. The second group, consisting of Documents 2, 4, 9, and 10, is discussed on page 
2. The third group, consisting of Documents 3, 5, 7, and 8, is discussed on page 3. There is a minimally 
sufficient description of an additional document and how it might contribute the argument at the end of 
the essay (pages 3–4), which earned 1 point for an additional document request. The essay attempts 
analysis of point of view for at least two documents (Document 1 on page 1 and Document 6 at the top of 
page 2), but these attempts were deemed too vague and speculative to earn the Basic Core point for point-
of-view analysis. 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2 

The essay earned 1 point for thesis. The thesis statement at the end of the introductory paragraph is weak, 
but a stronger version is found in the concluding paragraph (pages 3–4). The essay did not earn the Basic 
Core point for understanding the meaning of the documents, because it does not address Document 4 and 
Document 10 is misunderstood. The essay supports the thesis with appropriate evidence from the 
remaining eight documents (Documents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and it earned 1 point as a result. The 
essay attempts to construct three distinct groups of the documents, but only two were successful. The first 
group, consisting of Documents 1, 6, and 8, is discussed on pages 1–2. Document 8 is used in this group in 
a somewhat oblique way (to demonstrate the continued indifference of male-dominated governments to 
the plight of women), but that was deemed acceptable in this context. Group 2, consisting of Documents 2, 
3, 7, and 9, is discussed on pages 2–3. The third attempted group, consisting of Documents 5 and 10 
(discussed on page 3), was not credited because Document 10 is misread and because the essay does not 
show a common way in which the two documents demonstrate a relationship between gender and 
politics. (The rationale provided in the essay is that this group consists of documents whose viewpoints 
“didn’t exactly fit into the main two categories on the issue,” which was too vague to be credited.) 
Because there are only two successful document groups, the essay did not earn the Basic Core point for 
grouping the documents. The essay contains at least two attempts to analyze authorial point of view: one 
for Document 6 (bottom of page 1) and one for Document 1 (top of page 2), but neither of these attempts 
provides sufficient explanation beyond what is provided in the respective document source lines to earn 
the Basic Core point for point-of-view analysis. The essay did not earn the point for additional document 
request as there is no attempt made.
