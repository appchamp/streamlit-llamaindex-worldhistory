2015 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to select one of the regions provided (Latin America, including 
the Caribbean; or North America) and then to identify and explain changes and continuities in the selected 
region’s labor systems between circa 1450 and 1900. In particular the question measured the historical 
thinking skill of chronological reasoning (Skill 2), especially the subskill of working with patterns of change 
and continuity over time. The question directly addresses Periods 4 (1450–1750) and 5 (1750–1900). The 
question also directly addresses the fourth theme of the course (Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of 
Economic Systems) within a period when that theme is substantially related to many other historical 
developments of the period. The question most directly relates to Key Concepts 4.1 (the Atlantic System and 
the Columbian Exchange), 4.2 (New Forms of Social Organization and Modes of Production), 5.1 
(Industrialization and Global Capitalism), and 5.2 (Imperialism and Nation-State Formation). 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

There is a clear thesis in the first paragraph that includes both a change and continuity in labor systems 
during the period 1450–1900 (1 point). The essay addresses change and continuity: continuity is addressed 
in the second paragraph, multiple changes and one continuity are addressed in the third paragraph, and 
continuity is addressed in the fourth paragraph (2 points). The essay includes more than seven pieces of 
evidence (2 points). The essay includes world historical context in the third paragraph — European 
abolitionism; the fourth paragraph — European benefit and influence over demand that impacted labor; and 
the fifth paragraph — outside demand for Latin American products (1 point). The essay includes analysis of 
both continuity and change in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs (1 point). Multiple explanations, well-
articulated world historical context, and plentiful evidence earned an expanded core point (1 point). 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 5 

The essay does not employ a specific or qualified thesis related to change and continuity in labor systems; 
rather, it lists different systems. The essay addresses change and continuity: change is addressed in the first, 
second, and fourth paragraphs; and continuity is addressed in the second and third paragraphs (2 points). 
The essay includes more than seven pieces of evidence (2 points). The essay includes world historical 
context in the second paragraph — slaves were brought to Latin America via “the trans-Atlantic trade” (1 
point). The essay does not include analysis of change or continuity. Analysis requires more specificity, and 
the argument that the U.S. changed to a “globalized economy” needs to be situated more specifically in 
circumstances related to the U.S. or North America.
. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

The essay does not provide a qualified thesis related to change and continuity in labor systems. The essay 
addresses change in the first paragraph when referencing the switch from Native American to African slave 
labor (1 point). The essay includes three pieces of evidence in the first paragraph. It does not meet the 
threshold of five specific pieces of evidence. The essay does not attempt to provide world historical context. 
The essay does not include analysis of change or continuity. The essay repeats the points scored in the first 
paragraph in subsequent paragraphs, but it does not introduce any new information about change or 
continuity.
