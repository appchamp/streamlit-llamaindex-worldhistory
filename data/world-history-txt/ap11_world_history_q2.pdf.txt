If the thesis is repeated/restated in the conclusion it may count for credit

•  A statement that there were more changes than continuities does not 

constitute a thesis. 
•  The thesis may not

AP® WORLD HISTORY 
2011 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

This year’s question about continuity and change over time asked students to identify long-distance 
migrations from two different world regions and to analyze the changes and continuities in these 
migrations from 1700 to 1900. The open nature of the question allowed students to provide a variety of 
global examples within a rich time period and to demonstrate their understanding of global migrations. In 
addition, the focus of the question, demographic changes (migrations) in the 18th and 19th centuries, is a 
clearly identified topic and theme in the AP World History Course Description.  

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The student presents a clear thesis with qualification of both change and continuity within the first 
paragraph (1 point). The student clearly addresses change regarding the movement from the slave to 
indentured servant migration. Continuity is presented in a weaker manner regarding the continued 
migration of Europeans to Africa (2 points). The student provides clear evidence of change (potato famine, 
Australian penal colony, slaves, indentured servants, abolition, Chinese Exclusion Act, migrants to U.S.) in 
long-distance migrations throughout the essay but weaker evidence of continuity (Europeans to Africa)  
(2 points). The student presents a clear argument for global context for both change (abolition) and 
continuity (colonization) (1 point) and a clear argument for both change and continuity in long-distance 
migrations (1 point). The student received 1 expanded core point for evidence and analysis of global 
context for both change and continuity in long-distance migrations. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4  

The student does not provide a clear, qualified statement of continuity or long-distance migrations within 
the time period. The student addresses change in the Atlantic slave trade but does not address continuity 
(1 point). The student provides a minimal three pieces of evidence, with two coming from the introduction 
(technologies making migration easier, end of slavery, Africans into Caribbean/Americas) (1 point). The 
student provides a global context regarding the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition (1 point) and analyzes 
the abolition of the slave trade and its effect on long-distance migrations from Africa (1 point). 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The student does not provide a clear statement about change, continuity, or long-distance migrations 
within the time period and does not address either change or continuity within the essay. The student 
provides seven pieces of evidence of long-distance migration at a minimal level (European desire for 
money led to migrations, slave migration, forced African migration, European migration in the late 19th 
century, steamships, European shortage of food and jobs, opportunities in the United States) (2 points). 
There are attempts at global context (Atlantic slave trade, European migration, colonization, 
industrialization), but they are not connected to either change or continuity. The student makes no 
attempt at analysis.
