Question 2 — Long Essay Question  

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., the rise of large-scale empires led to increasing regional and transregional 
trade.  

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in this time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Scoring Note: Essays may discuss increases in any type of trade, including regional and local trade. 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the thesis must make 
a claim that responds to the prompt, 
rather than merely restating or rephrasing 
the prompt. The thesis must consist of 
one or more sentences located in one 
place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.  

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which the rise of 
one or more empires contributed to an increase in trade 
in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., with some 
indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, 
but must identify a relevant development or developments 
in the period. 

Examples: 
●  “In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. rising empires 
encouraged an increase in trade both within and 
across world regions in a variety of ways such as by 
providing peace and security, developing roads and 
markets, and issuing currencies.” (Responds to the 
prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line 
of reasoning.) 

●  “Empires in this period increased trade by providing 
security across their territories.” (Responds to the 
prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that 
establishes a line of reasoning.)  

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the rise of one or more empires 
and/or increasing trade in the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 
600 C.E. 

To earn this point, the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.  

Example: 
●  “In the period 600 B.C.E.-600 C.E., the rulers of many 
empires created more complex governments, raised 
larger armies, and some empires used new religions 
developing in this period to bolster their power.” 
(Relates broader events and developments to the 
topic.)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn the first point, the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to whether the 
rise of empires led to increases in trade in the period from 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Examples (acceptable):  
●  “The Persians used some of the first minted coins.” 
(Counts toward earning the point because there is a 
specific historical example relevant to the prompt.) 
●  “Parthia’s location contributed to the growth of 

trade in spices.” (Counts toward earning the point 
because there is a specific historical example relevant 
to the prompt.) 

●  “The network of paved roads in the Roman Empire 
helped increase trade in the empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

●  “The Qin and Han dynasties in China helped expand 
trade by standardizing weights and measures, and 
appointing market inspectors.” (Counts toward 
earning the point because there is a specific historical 
example relevant to the prompt.) 

Examples (unacceptable): 
●  “The paving of trade roads led to the growth of 

trading practices.” (Does not count toward earning the 
point because the information provided is not specific 
to a time and place.) 

●  “During the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. rising 

imperial states contributed to the growth of both 
regional and transregional trade, as people 
exchanged more goods.” (Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific 
information beyond what is provided in the 
introductory statement.)

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence. (2 points) 

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument 
in response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., the 
expansion of some empires increased trade while the 
expansion of other empires disrupted trade), then the 
response can earn the second evidence point by using only 
one specific historical example for each part of the 
multipart argument (but the total number of examples 
used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include:  
●  The Royal Road in the Persian Empire shortened 
travel times and stimulated trade between the 
capital and the provinces. 

●  The Hellenistic empires greatly expanded trade in 
the Eastern Mediterranean because of the common 
language and culture. 

●  The Han Dynasty used the Silk Road to export 

luxury goods to distant locations. 

●  The Roman Empire developed a system of state 

sponsored purchases of grain from Egypt in order 
to feed the growing population of Rome.

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (1 point) 

To earn the first point, the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about the extent to which the 
rise of one or more empires contributed to 
an increase in trade in the period from 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain the extent 
to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
●  Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation 
contributed to the geographic expansion of trade 
networks 

●  Explaining how imperial expansion or 

consolidation led to growing demand for trade 
goods 

●  Explaining how imperial expansion or 

consolidation led to the drawing of new peoples 
into commercial networks

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (2 points) 

To earn the second point, the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the extent to which the 
rise of one more empires contributed to 
an increase in trade in the period from 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
●  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument about how trade 
expansion in this period was mostly accomplished 
by nonimperial actors, such as commercial city-
states (as in Phoenicia and Greece) or merchant 
groups (such as Sogdians or diaspora Jews) 
●  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
the rise of empires generally expanded trade, but in 
other cases limited trade either by disrupting 
existing trade networks (for example, Alexander’s 
conquests led to an economic and commercial 
decline of the core Persian territories) or by empires 
implementing policies to limit the power of 
merchants (for example, the Han Dynasty imposing 
heavy taxes on merchants and limiting their ability 
to own land) 

●  Explaining relevant and insightful connections 

across time and space, such as explaining how the 
rise of empires in Eurasia contributed both to the 
increased trade in the so-called First Silk Roads 
period (from circa 50 B.C.E. to circa 200 C.E.) and to 
the revival of that trade in the so-called Second Silk 
Roads period (from circa 700 to circa 1200 C.E.) 

This demonstration of complex understanding must be 
part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument.  

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an 
increase in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.  

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Scoring Note: Essays may discuss increases in any type of trade, including regional and local trade. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. rising empires encouraged the increase in trade both within and 
across world regions in a variety of ways such as by providing peace and security, developing roads 
and markets, and issuing currencies.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes 
a line of reasoning.) 
“Although the rise of large-scale empires certainly contributed to expanding trade in the period 600 
B.C.E.–600 C.E., it was only one of several factors in doing so, other factors being population growth, the 
growth of cities, and improved technological and environmental knowledge.” (Responds to the prompt 
with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“Empires in this period increased trade by providing security across their territories.” (Responds to the 
prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

•  From 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.  many large empires developed and led to increasing regional and 

• 

• 

transregional commercial connections. (Offers a historically defensible claim, but it includes no additional 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Most empires in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.  depended on long-distance transregional trade for 
the daily needs of their growing populations.” (Not a historically defensible claim.)  
“Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire and spread Greek culture in the period from 600 
B.C.E. to 600 C.E.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference a specific factor relevant to 
how imperial expansion affected the growth of trade.)  

•  The Roman Empire went through a long period of peace, called the Pax Romana. (Potentially relevant 

but has no clear link to trade.) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. This point is not awarded 
for merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the rise of one or more empires 
and/or increasing trade in the period circa 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E.-600 C.E., the rulers of many empires created more complex governments, 
raised larger armies, and used some of the new religions developing in this period to bolster their 
power.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The period from around 600 B.C.E. to around 600 C.E. is sometimes referred to as the “Axial Age.” 
(Potentially relevant but is merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe.”) 
“In India, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka completed the conquest of Kalinga and then focused on 
spreading and promoting Buddhism.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to increases in trade.) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of whether the rise of 
empires led to increases in trade in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. These examples of evidence must be 
different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“The network of paved roads in the Roman Empire helped increase trade in the empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“During the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., rising imperial states contributed to the growth of both 
regional and transregional trade, as people exchanged more goods.” (Does not count toward earning the 
point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement.) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which the rise of one or more empires contributed to an increase in trade 
in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Empires often led to an expansion trade within their boundaries simply by establishing and maintaining 
peace and the rule of law over large areas. In the Roman Empire in the first and second century C.E., the 
Pax Romana was a long period of prosperity and booming trade. In China, after the upheavals of the 
short-lived Qin Dynasty, the Han Dynasty established a period of peace and public order that lasted 
several centuries, also leading to an expansion of trade.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in 
accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt.)  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which the rise of one or more empires led to an increase in trade from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. To earn this 
point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, 
although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

• 

• 
• 

Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation contributed to the geographic expansion of trade 
networks 
Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation led to growing demand for trade goods 
Explaining how imperial expansion or consolidation led to the drawing of new peoples into commercial 
networks

Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the agency and role of 
empires and empire-building in the increase in trade from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. The question addressed Key 
Concepts 2.3.I, 2.3.II, and 2.3.III of the AP World History Curriculum Framework. Students were expected to 
address the means by which states facilitated the expansion of trade through policies, administration, 
infrastructure development, and the provision of security. Responses were to address one or more specific 
empires in the period. The question tested students’ ability to utilize multiple historical reasoning skills and 
disciplinary practices, specifically Argument Development, Contextualization, and Causation. While the 
question was focused upon causation, there were successful student responses that compared the roles that 
various rising empires played in increasing trade. There were also opportunities for responses to discuss 
changes and continuities over time regarding the role of empires in increasing trade. The question was broadly 
constructed geographically and was open to multiple answers drawn from various regions and empires within 
the Classical Era. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim at the end of the first paragraph. The thesis identifies two ways in 
which the rise of “large-scale empires” increased trade: “creation of road and water networks” and “the 
standardization of currency.” The thesis also briefly describes the commercial benefits of each of these types of 
imperial policies. The response also earned 1 point for contextualization because (at the beginning of the 
introductory paragraph) there is a discussion of the limitations of trade networks in the period before 600 B.C.E. 
This discussion states that Sumerian and ancient Egyptian trade networks were “slow to travel on,” “risky,” 
and “un-standardized,” while, in East Asia, the Shang and Zhou dynasties “mainly focused on regional trade 
rather than transregional trade, as the fertile land near the Yellow River was fairly self-sufficient.” While some 
of these statements are overgeneralizations, they nonetheless serve to effectively set the stage for the argument 
about the benefits of imperial policies on trade after 600 B.C.E. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence. It contains multiple examples of empires’ influence on trade, 
including the “extensive road networks” built by the Roman and the Achaemenid Persian empires; Roman 
leaders need to “trade for more resources and food for their populations, or suffer/face popular unrest”; “urban 
and elite demand for luxury products from culturally diverse regions”; “standardization of currency, for 
example in the Han dynasty”; commercial provisions in laws such as “the 12 Roman Tables,” etc. The 
response also successfully and explicitly connects most of these pieces of evidence to arguments or claims 
about the prompt. For instance, the evidence of the Roman and Persian roads (pages 1–2) is used in support of 
claim regarding empires’ need for “rapid communication,” “mobilization of the military,” and increasing 
revenues “through trade and trade taxation.” 

The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning because there are multiple examples of the 
successful use of the historical reasoning process of Causation to explain the effects of the rise of empires on 
trade. For example, the importance of the standardization of the currency under the Han Empire (on page 2) is 
explained both by linking it to motivations/causes (Han rulers’ desire to “increase their profitability and lower 
luxury-item cost”) and effects of the policy (“increased transregional trade, especially along the Silk Road”). 
The second and third paragraphs contain several other examples of successful use of historical reasoning.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it employs a variety of 
detailed examples of trade throughout the time period. The response presents a complex contextualization of 
the Roman Republic and Empire, particularly in its rise and growth into a dominant regional power. The 
response also demonstrates a deep knowledge of trading patterns and goods that moved along the trade routes 
during the time period. Finally, the response weaves the wide breadth of knowledge and use of historical 
thinking skills throughout, creating a conclusion that contextualizes the fall of Rome and the effect that its fall 
had on trade. 

The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it displays an extensive use 
of historical reasoning skills. Complexity is demonstrated by the response’s reference to multiple causes and 
effects pertaining to the historical processes being discussed. The extensive comparison (in the last paragraph) 
of the effects of imperial trade practices in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. and the effects of European 
imperial trade practices in the period from 1450 to 1750 C.E. probably would not have been sufficient, by itself, 
to earn the complexity point; however, when added to an already well-developed and nuanced argument, it 
works well and contributes to the earning of the point. The cross-period comparison includes some insightful 
observations, for example, the comparison of roads and “banking and credit systems” as factors leading to 
greater safety in long-distance trade in their respective time periods. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim. The attempted thesis at the end of the introductory 
paragraph (“Because of the Roman Empire and Han & Qin China, trade increased dramatically from 600BC – 
600 AD.”) contains only a token modification of the information provided in the introductory statement of the 
prompt and does not provide a discernible line of reasoning. The preceding statement that “once these empires 
had risen, trade began to fluorish, along the silk road” also fails to establish a line of reasoning. However, the 
discussion in the introductory paragraph did earn the response the point for contextualization. It did so by 
providing a brief synopsis of some of the factors leading to the emergence of empires in the Classical period 
(rulers “using religion and architecture to legitimize their rule”) and by sketching out specific historical details 
concerning the rise of two empires (the Qin Empire in China and Ashoka’s Mauryan Empire in India). While 
only marginally connected to trade or trade policies, this discussion is nonetheless sufficient to provide 
historical context for the argument. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence. The evidence provided in the response is the bare minimum 
needed to earn the 2 points, both in terms of the number of pieces of evidence used and the extent to which the 
evidence is used effectively in support of claims or arguments. The response develops the arguments that 
Roman roads were built to facilitate trade and connect rising urban centers (paragraph 2) and that Roman 
policies encouraged seaborne trade in the Mediterranean “by establishing ports along both South Europe and 
coastal North Africa.” (paragraph 4). The discussion of Chinese silk production and the Silk Roads (paragraph 
3) is not connected to the rise of any Chinese state, or to any Chinese imperial policy; therefore, it was not 
credited toward earning the evidence points. 

The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning. The second and fourth paragraphs contain 
examples of using the historical reasoning process of Causation to address both causes of Roman road and 
port building and the effects of these building projects on trade. However, the response did not earn the point 
for demonstrating a complex understanding because its use of evidence and historical reasoning is minimal, 
and there is no indication of awareness of historical complexity or nuance.

The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim. There are attempts at a thesis in both the introduction and 
the conclusion. While both attempts include a historically defensible claim (“the rise of large-scale empires led 
to increasing regional and transregional trade”) and both attempts include a discussion of trade on the Silk 
Roads, there is no clear line of reasoning connecting the rise of empires to trade, on the Silk Roads or 
elsewhere. The inclusion of “the Muslim Empire” also detracts from the argument, since Islam is out of the 
period. 

The response did not earn the point for contextualization. There is no clear attempt at contextualization in the 
response. There is a discussion of the “Muslim empire” (in paragraph 3), presumably the Abbasid Caliphate; 
however, the response incorrectly identifies this “Muslim empire” as being part of the time period indicated in 
the prompt, and its general use suggests that it is being offered as evidence, rather than as contextualization. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence. There are two lines of argument developed in the body 
paragraphs of the response: the role of the Byzantine Empire as a “Middle Man” in long-distance trade 
(paragraph 2) and China’s role as supplier of the sought-after trade good of silk (paragraph 4). The addition of 
“Chompa rice” to the discussion in paragraph 4 was treated as a read-through error, as the adoption of 
Champa rice in China occurred outside of the time period of the prompt. For each of these lines of argument, 
the response provides a few examples of evidence that directly reference either state involvement or the impact 
of state policies (taxing trade, providing “safe passage,” use of caravanserai, etc.). While much of the 
discussion in these paragraphs is oversimplified and monocausal, there was enough both in terms of the 
number of pieces of evidence used and of connecting the evidence to the argument to earn both points. 

The response did not earn the point for using historical reasoning. An attempt is made to show causation by 
discussing the benefits of Champa rice’s fast ripening cultivation cycle for China (paragraph 4); however, 
because this discussion is chronologically inaccurate (out of period), it was not credited for the historical 
reasoning point. The response also did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding. There is 
no attempt to expand the scope of the argument outside of the time period or to create nuance beyond a general 
statement of evidence.
