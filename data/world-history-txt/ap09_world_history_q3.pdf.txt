AP® WORLD HISTORY 
2009 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3—Comparative 

Overview 

This question asked students to compare the racial ideologies and social effects of those ideologies in two 
regions: North America and Latin America (including the Caribbean). The question focused on several 
important AP World History themes as expressed in the time period (1500–1830): racial and ethnic 
constructions; labor systems; state building and expansion; the interaction of cultures; migration and 
disease; and belief systems, philosophies, and ideologies. In fact, all of the themes were relevant to this 
question. Further, the question required students to articulate a reason for the similarities or differences 
between the two regions (analysis). 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 9 

The thesis, located in the introductory paragraph, expresses both similarities and differences between North 
and Latin America and discusses both racial ideology (“racial prejudices and stereotypes”) and social effects 
(“treatment of native people … and slaves) (1 point). The student addresses both regions, as well as both 
racial ideas brought by Europeans, and consequences in a relatively sophisticated answer, identifying 
similarities and differences (2 points). The essay includes ample, appropriate historical evidence, showing 
understanding of the impacts of different European colonizers on the regions they controlled (2 points). 
The student makes clear, direct comparisons throughout, covering such areas as the differences between 
the ill-treatment of native peoples and African slaves in North America and Latin America (1 point). The 
relatively sophisticated analysis offers clear explanations for distinct racial regimes, connecting those 
differences to the reasons for differing social and political revolutions that occurred later (1 point). The 
essay earned 2 expanded core points for its clear, analytical thesis, sophisticated analysis, consistent 
comparisons, and ample evidence, and for relating ideology in the New World to the impact of European 
settlers’ ideas (world context). 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 5 

The thesis is adequate, identifying both racial ideology (“viewed the black population as inferior”) and 
differing social effects in both regions (1 point). The essay focuses on differences between the two regions. 
The student does not mention a similarity but responds to other parts of the question (1 point). While more 
evidence is provided for North America, there is adequate evidence for both regions (2 points). The direct 
comparison identifies the key difference between racial blending in Latin America and racial separation in 
North America (1 point). There is no analysis. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 3 

The attempted thesis is comparative but addresses only racial effects (“racial ladders that only allowed 
certain races to succeed”) and not ideology. The student discusses both regions, ideology, social effects 
(who “was at the top of the list and … at the bottom”), and a similarity in the first sentence of the second 
paragraph, but no differences (1 point). The evidence includes one example from each region (1 point). The 
essay also includes an adequate comparison in the first sentence of the second paragraph (“North and 
Latin America/Caribbean had racial ladders that told which race was superior to the others”) (1 point). 
There is no analysis.
