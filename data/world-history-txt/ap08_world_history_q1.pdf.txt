Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence)

•  The thesis must address at least two factors that shaped the modern Olympics. 
•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay.

(May misinterpret 1 document.) 

•  Students must address all 10 documents in the essay. 
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least 9  

documents. 

•  Documents must be addressed individually to show understanding in a way that goes  

beyond listing and attribution.

1 Point 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but 1 document. 

2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Evidence must be drawn from 9 or 10 documents and address the question.

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least 2 documents. 

1 Point 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least 2 documents. 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person or organization might have  
this particular opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point  
of view.

and explaining the tone, the characteristics and experiences of the author, the  
intended audience, and/or how the intended outcome may have influenced the  
author’s opinion.

trade benefits, finances.

2008 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Overview 

For the document-based question, students were expected to analyze factors that shaped the modern 
Olympic movement in the context of major events in the twentieth century. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 8 

The thesis outlines factors shaping the modern Olympics and correctly places them in the relevant 
historical context of the time period (1 point). There are four groupings: peace, political interests, economic 
interests (“incentive for sponsoring as well as hosting the games”), and social reform (female athletes) (1 
point). The essay demonstrates understanding of all 10 documents (1 point) and correctly uses evidence 
from 9 documents to answer the question (2 points). Document 5 is inverted, expressing the effects of the 
Olympics on Japan, and therefore did not count for evidence of factors that affected the Olympics. There is 
analysis of point of view for three documents (Documents 4, 6, and 10) (1 point). The request for additional 
documents from people who were not athletes or people from Africa and South America shows awareness of 
other factors that could have affected the Olympics in the time period (1 point). An expanded core point was 
earned for additional analysis of documents through groupings and of point of view (1 point). 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6 

The thesis identifies four factors that shaped the modern Olympic movement: “women’s suffrage, global 
economy, world wars, and proving competency” (1 point). There are four groupings: feminism, economics, 
wars, and national rivalry/nationalism (1 point). The essay demonstrates understanding of 10 documents  
(1 point) and uses evidence correctly from 9 documents to answer the question (2 points). There is analysis 
of point of view for two documents (Documents 6 and 10) (1 point). Two additional documents are requested, 
but no point was earned since the essay does not link those additional types of documents to factors affecting 
the Olympics.  

Sample: 1C 
Score: 4 

The thesis identifies three factors that shaped the modern Olympic movement: “nationalism,” “host country 
to show off,” and “feminism” (1 point). There are three document groupings: peace (Documents 1 and 6), 
nationalism (Documents 3, 4, and 10), and feminism (Documents 2 and 8) (1 point). The essay 
demonstrates understanding of all 10 documents (1 point). No points were awarded for evidence because 
the documents are used to support the inverse of the question, i.e., how the Olympics had consequences 
or effects. There is analysis of point of view for three documents (Documents 3, 4, and 7) (1 point). No point 
was earned for the request of an additional document because the explanation of how the requested 
documents would help assess a factor that shaped the modern Olympics is incomplete.
