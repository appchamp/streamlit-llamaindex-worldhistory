2013 SCORING COMMENTARY  

Question 3 

Overview  

The question asked students to identify and explain similarities and differences between the role of the 
state in the economic development of Japan and in one other country (China, the Ottoman Empire, or 
Russia) during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In particular, the question measured the historical 
thinking skill of comparison and contextualization (Skill 3) and Key Concept 5.1 (Industrialization and 
Global Capitalism), sections II and V. The question assessed content and thematic knowledge of portions 
of Period 5 (1750–1900) and Period 6 (1900–present). The question specifically focuses on Themes 4 and 3: 
“Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems” and “State-Building, Expansion, and 
Conflict.” 

Sample: 3A  
Score: 8 

The student writes a thesis paragraph that addresses both a specific, valid similarity and a specific, valid 
difference (1 point). The essay also earned 2 points for addressing all parts of the question: it provides a 
valid similarity as the topic sentence of the first body paragraph and a valid difference on the bottom of 
page 2 continuing to the top of page 3.There are numerous pieces of evidence throughout this essay, 
including two pieces of evidence for Russia at the bottom of page 1 and four pieces of evidence for Japan 
on page 2 (2 points). The direct comparison begins at the bottom of page 3 and extends through the rest of 
that paragraph (1 point). The analysis of why this difference in the state’s use of natural resources exists is 
woven throughout the direct comparison (1 point). This essay earned 1 expanded core point for its use of 
ample historical detail to substantiate the thesis.  

Sample: 3B 
Score: 5 

The student makes an attempt at a thesis, but the similarity aspect is tied to culture, not the role of the 
state in economic development. This off-topic problem continues in the scoring element that addresses 
similarity. The similarity that the student addresses in the last paragraph is tied to culture, not to the 
economic role of the state. There is a minimally acceptable, but valid, difference addressed on page 1 in 
the topic sentence of the second paragraph. Another valid example of addressing a difference is found on 
the bottom of page 1, “Unlike the Japanese government, the Chinese government did not push 
industrialization and economic development was very little if not none” (1 point). The evidence for Japan in 
this essay is extensive and the evidence for China is adequate, so 2 evidence points were earned. There 
are two direct comparisons in this essay. The first is a direct comparison, which is a difference identified 
in the unsuccessful thesis, and the second is the last sentence of the paragraph ending in the middle of 
page 3 (1 point). Analysis for the direct comparison is found on the bottom of page 2 as the student 
explains why Japan welcomed western influence in technology and industrialization and China did not (1 
point).

Question 3 (continued) 

Sample: 3C 
Score:  1 

The essay begins with an attempt at a thesis, “The role of the state was more prominent in Russian society 
than Japanese society,” but it does not contain a similarity element, and it is too general to have earned 
the thesis point. The similarity, which counted for an “addresses” point, extends from the middle of page 1 
to the bottom of the page. It begins, “At the start of the 19th century, Japan was a very reclusive country, 
keeping its economy and technology to itself” and continues at the bottom of the page, “The Russians in 
the early 19th century were also behind the likes of the major European powers.” Though this similarity is 
stated as true of the early 19th century, it is also true of c. 1850, so the similarity counted (1 point). There is 
an attempt on page 2 to address difference, but it is a discussion of politics, not the role of the state in 
economic development. This essay has three pieces of Japan evidence, all found on the first page, but no 
scorable evidence for Russia. There is no attempt at a direct comparison, and so there is no analysis of the 
reason for the direct comparison.
