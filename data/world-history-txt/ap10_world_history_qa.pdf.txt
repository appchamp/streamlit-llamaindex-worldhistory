Student Performance Q&A: 

2010 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2010 free-response questions for AP® World History were 
written by the Chief Reader, Merry Wiesner-Hanks, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and 
Question Leaders Tim Keirn, California State University, Long Beach; Kathy Callahan, Murray 
State University, Ky.; and Ryba Epstein, Rich East High School, Park Forest, Ill. They give an 
overview of each free-response question and of how students performed on the question, 
including typical student errors. General comments regarding the skills and content that 
students frequently have the most problems with are included. Some suggestions for 
improving student performance in these areas are also provided. Teachers are encouraged to 
attend a College Board workshop to learn strategies for improving student performance in 
specific areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

The intent of the question was to compare the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton 
textile industry in Japan and India during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Unlike most 
recent document-based questions (DBQs), these documents could not simply be classified in one 
category for analysis. Many of the 10 documents had internal evidence that represented multiple 
characteristics of mechanization. Given the richness and diversity of the sources, students could 
use individual documents in a variety of ways to represent different characteristics of 
mechanization in India and Japan and to provide multiple differences and similarities between the 
two. Documents could be grouped in a variety of ways: for example, in terms of growth in 
production, gender of the labor forces, traditional forms of production, and labor conditions in both 
India and Japan. Attribution for the individual documents was clear and provided ample 
opportunities for discussion of point of view and analysis of potential additional documents and 
sources.  

AP Exam Readers were enthusiastic in their view that this was an exemplary DBQ in terms of both 
the question and the ease and reliability of applying the scoring guidelines. Students were given 
the opportunity to construct arguments in myriad ways, with evidence found internally within the 
same document(s). The question was very efficiently and accurately scored. 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 3.03 out of a possible 9 points, significantly higher than last year’s mean of 
2.62; 4.6 percent of students received a score of 7, 8 or 9, a figure that was also significantly higher 
than last year’s 2.9 percent of students receiving top scores. Because the question required 
students to look at the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry in both Japan 
and India, not at attitudes toward or responses to mechanization, students were able to organize

groups more easily, focus on the content of the documents, develop points of view, and identify 
and explain additional documents that were directly connected to the question. 

Given the extent of evidence to be found within each document, students could use a broad 
spectrum of strategies, and there was no clear pattern or tendency in their groupings of 
documents. The variety of responses was a consequence of both the richness of the documents 
and the comparative nature of the question. Not only did students successfully use documents in 
multiple groupings around coherent patterns of the characteristics of mechanization in Japan and 
India, but they also grouped documents in a comparative analysis of the two (e.g., comparing the 
predominance of men in Indian factories [Document 10] with the predominance of women in 
Japanese factories [Documents 7 and 8]). Admirably, many students used a single document to 
provide evidence of a variety of characteristics, putting the same document in multiple groupings. 

Most students grouped the documents around coherent characteristics of mechanization in each 
country. Given the large number of potential subgroupings manifest in the documents, a minimum 
of three groupings was required. Many of the stronger essays created distinct subgroupings within 
overarching themes (e.g., making distinctions between dangerous or substandard conditions and 
low wages). Students with reasonable writing skills and the ability to make relevant comparisons 
were able to craft acceptable thesis statements, plausibly drawn from the documents, that 
identified multiple characteristics of mechanization. The scoring guidelines permitted students to 
demonstrate basic understanding of the documents through accurate grouping or discussion of 
Japanese or Indian characteristics, so this was the most widely earned core point. Earning the 
thesis point proved more difficult, as discussed in the next section of this “Q&A.” 

When students addressed point of view, they generally did so with competence, for example, when 
discussing the position of the document’s author with regard to the content of the document (e.g., 
a British official’s unemotional description of working conditions in Indian factories [Document 9] 
or the two Japanese girls’ painful recollections of factory life [Document 3]).  When students 
discussed an additional document, they most often recognized that the perspective of an Indian 
worker was missing, or that an Indian woman may have provided a relevant comparison with her 
Japanese counterparts. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Although the mean score and number of students who received a 7, 8 or 9 on the 2010 DBQ were 
higher than in the preceding year, nonetheless the number of students receiving a score of 7 or 
above was still lower than desired. Three major problems are apparent when examining student 
responses to this question. 

  Core Point 1 — Although many students did attempt a thesis, to receive this point they 
needed to provide explicit comparisons between the characteristics of mechanization for 
both Japan and India. Many students failed to make any direct comparisons or to provide 
an explicit similarity or difference.  

  Core Point 4 — Although many students did attempt to discuss point of view, they did 
not successfully analyze the documents. A few confused interpretation with point of view 
or made vague statements about bias without any form of analysis, and many simply 
accepted the “objectivity” of the images and the charts without critical reflection. More 
needs to be done to encourage students to see point of view in these types of sources. 

  Core Point 6 — Students often asked for another point of view or document that was 
potentially relevant but did not explain how it would enhance understanding of the 
mechanization of the cotton industry in Japan or India. Missing points of view that

overlapped with Documents 1–5 were accepted (if adequately explained), given that the 
sources cited for those documents did not identify the types of document they were. 

Although the bar for basic understanding was low, some students misinterpreted documents by 
forcing their analysis into a perceived category instead of making a more direct analysis (e.g., 
seeing the photos in Documents 8 and 10 as illustrating poor working conditions because the 
women are not smiling, without explanation or recognition of the posed nature of the photographs; 
stating that Japan was less successful or had failed because its overall production was “lower” than 
that of India [Documents 1 and 2]). 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

Teachers should be commended for having their students write the DBQ with greater attention to 
the directions. More than any other year, students answered the question more directly, made 
greater attempts to choose the additional document and analyze point of view, and generally 
grouped the documents in multiple categories of analysis. When students are practicing sample 
DBQs, they should be required to group the documents in at least three ways. 

Even though more students directly addressed point of view, teachers need to continue to model 
this and allocate class time for practice so that recognizing point of view becomes an established 
habit of mind for their students. Students also must explain the request for additional documents 
within the context of the task posed by the question. In general, more needs to be done to enforce 
the point-of-view and additional document requirements as analytical tools throughout the course 
and not just as a requirement for this exam.  

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

This year’s question about continuity and change over time asked students to describe and explain 
continuities and changes in religious beliefs and practices in either sub-Saharan Africa or Latin 
America/the Caribbean from 1450 to the present. The intent of the question was to have students 
explain how those practices and beliefs changed, as well as how they remained the same, over a 
550-year time period. Students needed to choose the region or continent about which they felt 
most knowledgeable. Further, students were asked to accurately explain a reason for, or an impact 
of, a continuity or change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices. Understanding of religious 
beliefs and practices is an important component of instruction in the AP World History course.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

Students performed higher on this type of question than they did in the two previous years. This 
year’s mean score was 3 out of a possible 9 points, exceeding the means of 2.67 in 2009 and 2.60 in 
2008. Five percent of students earned a score of 7, 8 or 9, compared with 4.5 percent in 2009 and 
4 percent in 2008. Students demonstrated significant improvements in writing — essays were 
better organized, and students made genuine efforts to earn higher scores by showing their 
historical knowledge. More students attempted to answer the question this year. Students were 
well versed in historical evidence (facts); this was especially true of those who wrote about Latin 
America.  

Compared with student responses in previous years, many more students understood and could 
write about world historical context and analyze the causes for continuity and change. Numerous

responses included eloquent discussions of the continuity of religious beliefs and practices that 
Christianity brought to Latin America and Islam to sub-Saharan Africa. A few also wrote about the  
continuity of Christian beliefs and practices in sub-Saharan Africa by discussing Ethiopia and the 
subsequent arrival of Europeans (Portuguese exploration and post–Berlin Conference imperialism).  
Students were also familiar with other continuities, such as the syncretism of different belief and 
practice systems and the persistence of animist beliefs and practices.  

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Students continue to struggle with writing solid thesis statements. Many failed to include the 
dates as called for in the question. These dates had to be specific. For example, a thesis that 
included only the words “From 1450 on …” or “Since 1450 …” was not awarded a point as this did 
not specifically address the entire time period. Students who wrote “From 1450 to the present” or 
“In the Early Modern era to the 21st century” (or something similar) and met the other thesis 
requirements earned the point because these phrases clearly indicated a specific range of time.  

Students were clearly comfortable with the concept of change but considerably less comfortable 
with the concept of continuity, and the latter was not specifically addressed in most theses. Many 
thesis statements were not valid because the student left out continuity; in addition, numerous 
essays with strong discussions of change received low scores because the responses did not 
address continuity at all.   

Students often provided voluminous amounts of information that did not translate into relevant 
evidence. Moreover, some responses included far too much background information (from before 
1450) while failing to address the entire time period as called for by the question, or to relate the 
background to continuity or change in the specified period. Often students relayed the same 
evidence over and over again. Also, many students were confused about Catholicism’s historical 
relationship to Christianity. 

While improvement in addressing world historical context was evident, some students seemed 
genuinely puzzled about what was necessary when answering this question. Many made 
comparisons between regions instead of connections between regions or to global trends 
appropriate to the particular question. To earn a point for using relevant world historical context, 
students needed to be more focused on specific global links; for example, saying that “China and 
Brazil both had Jesuit missionaries” was a comparison, not a connection, unless the student drew 
it specifically (e.g., “European Jesuit missionaries were proselytizing in South America and 
winning converts. This happened in China as well.”). The term “European Jesuits” provided a 
specific reference showing how European practices affected South American beliefs. 

In general, students demonstrated less comfort writing about sub-Saharan Africa than about Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Many showed clear historical understanding of Mali, Ghana, Ibn 
Batutta and Mansa Musa, but this information is outside the required time period of the question. 

Occasionally students stumbled into analysis because of the “cause and impact” nature of the 
prompt. While efforts made in this category were better overall, too many students showed little 
understanding of analysis, often providing only factual information. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

More effort needs to be directed toward helping students learn to write thorough, concise thesis 
statements. Far too many students still write a thesis that simply parrots the question (e.g., “There 

4

were many continuities and changes regarding religious practices and beliefs in sub-Saharan 
Africa”). Underscore the importance of qualifying the information requested in the question. For  
example: “Some Africans kept their polytheistic beliefs,” not “Some Africans kept their beliefs.”  

Encourage students to think in terms of the periodization outlined in the AP World History Course 
Description (for this question: 1450–1750; 1750–1914; 1914 to the present), as it relates to the 
question. This approach would move students beyond a mechanistic “beginning, middle and end” 
format and give them a chance to demonstrate solid chronological knowledge. Applying this 
methodology also encourages them to cover the entire time period. Further, students should 
include dates in their essays to demonstrate that they know exactly when continuity and change 
occurred. 

Additional teaching on African cultural life is important; students may benefit from exposure to 
graphic organizers specific to either time periods or regions.  

Far too many students were unable to clearly demonstrate their understanding of historical 
continuity. This certainly challenges teachers and students alike on many levels, as textbooks are 
less explicit about continuity; this should be a point of emphasis in instruction.  

Solid historical analysis explains the reason for or impact of a continuity or a change. While 
students have improved in this area, they need continued instruction. This year’s question tended 
to naturally lend itself to analysis, but more often than not, students wrote whatever facts they 
knew and were not specific about cause and impact.   

Continue to urge students to write objectively, leaving personal opinions, in this case of religious 
practices, out of their responses.  

Teaching students to write essays that attempt to organize the material politically, economically, 
socially and culturally, or in some other set formula, suggests to students that all answers can be 
forced into a pedagogically weak format. Often this approach will not work for the particular 
question posed.   

Encourage students to write or print clearly; in the age of electronic communication, handwriting 
seems to be a dying transmission form. Every good faith effort is made to read what students write 
(often three to four people labor for several hours over illegible handwriting). Improved penmanship 
would assist in more efficient scoring of student responses.  

Question 3 

What was the intent of this question? 

The intent of the question was for students to pick two of the stipulated empires — Han China (206 
B.C.E. to 220 C.E.), Mauryan/Gupta India (320 B.C.E. to 550 C.E.), Imperial Rome (31 B.C.E. to 476 C.E.) 
— and compare the ways those empires exerted political control over their populaces. Students 
were explicitly told to discuss both similarities and differences in methods of political control. 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 1.86, significantly lower than last year’s mean of 2.74, and the number of 
students who received a score of 7, 8 or 9 was also lower, 2.7 percent, as compared with last year’s 
5.6 percent. The comparative question continues to receive many scores of 0; many students do 
not even attempt a response or write off-topic essays. In addition, this question tested material that 
many students had covered very early in the course or in some cases the year before, and they may

not have reviewed adequately. Students could choose from three empires for this question, and 
most chose to compare Imperial Rome with the Han dynasty, reflecting the emphasis in many 
major textbooks. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

While student writing has improved over the last several years, students still often failed to write a 
thesis that actually addressed all the tasks laid out in the question. They needed to address at least 
one valid similarity and one valid difference between methods of political control (in other words, 
governance) in the two empires. 

Some students attempted a comparison but not in political terms; they included information on 
trade, military history, religion, invasions and gender but did not tie these to methods of 
governance.  

Some students failed to address all parts of the question, instead discussing only similarities or only 
differences between methods of political control for the two empires. Others attempted to compare 
all three empires. A few tried to compare the Maurya with the Gupta. 

Students rarely provided analysis. They either ignored this task entirely or reversed cause and 
effect. Others attempted analysis but not as an explanation of a similarity or difference between 
methods of political control. Sometimes the analysis was strictly internal to one empire or the other, 
such as a discussion of why the empire fell. 

Many students used supporting evidence that was outside the time period or was not from any of 
the stipulated empires (e.g., Roman Republic, Qin dynasty, Genghis Khan, Mansa Musa or Akbar). 
If the evidence was relevant it often had little to do with methods of political control. Some 
students simply wrote what they knew about the empires without directly responding to tasks set 
by the question. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

Spend more time teaching students how to analyze the question so that they understand what it is 
asking them to do and can organize their response so that it addresses all parts of the question. 

Discourage students from constructing answers to comparison questions by discussing one region 
as a block and then the other region as a block, loosely linked by a transitional sentence. That 
sentence often was the only comparison in the response, and if it was incorrect the student was 
unable to earn any points for comparison, analysis or addressing the question.  

Discourage students from writing to a preexisting format, such as political, economic, 
social/cultural or PERSIA (Political, Economic, Religious, Social, Intellectual, Artistic). Students 
need to respond to the question asked — which in this case was political. 

Help students improve their understanding of content and chronology, and remind them to limit 
their responses to the appropriate period or empire. 

Have students practice writing to a variety of prompts throughout the year. 

A general note: The AP Reading provides an incomparable professional development experience 
for teachers. By helping to score the free-response questions and talking with other Exam Readers,

teachers learn strategies for teaching students how to write the three types of essays that appear 
on the exam. The Reading not only offers on-the-job-training but provides those teaching AP World 
History a valuable professional network. Although many school districts currently face economic 
difficulties, permitting teachers to attend the Reading is a good use of resources that can have a 
positive impact on student performance on future AP Exams.
