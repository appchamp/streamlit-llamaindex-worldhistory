Short Answer Question 4 

Overview 

This question asked students to identify three technologies that have contributed to globalization since the 
end of the Second World War and explain how each one contributed to globalization. Students earned 1 point 
for each technology that was identified and for explaining how that technology contributed to globalization. 
This question tested students’ ability to understand causal relationships between technology and 
globalization and apply specific evidence in support of those interpretations, given the timeline provided. 

Sample: 4A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned the point because it identifies the Internet as a technology that emerged after the 
Second World War and explains that the Internet contributes to globalization by connecting people “all over 
the world.” 

b) The response earned the point because it identifies the cell phone as a technology that emerged after the 
Second World War and explains that the cell phone contributes to globalization by also connecting people 
worldwide. 

c) The response earned the point because it identifies music players as a technology that emerged after the 
Second World War and explains that music players contributed to globalization by spreading different types 
of music and culture across the world. 

Sample: 4B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned the point because it identifies the Internet as a technology that emerged after the 
Second World War and explains that the Internet contributes to globalization by increasing global 
communication and commerce. 

b) The response did not earn the point because the radio was invented before the Second World War. In 
addition, while the response explains that the radio allowed people to acquire information more quickly and 
discuss that information with their friends and family, the response does not explain how that development 
contributed to globalization.  

c) The response earned the point because it identifies the mobile phone as a technology that emerged after 
the Second World War and explains that the mobile phone contributed to globalization by enhancing global

Short Answer Question 4 (continued) 

Sample: 4C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because airplanes were invented before the Second World War and 
trans-Atlantic travel via the airplane was also possible before the Second World War. If the response had 
specifically mentioned improvements in commercial airline technology that took place after the Second 
World War and allowed for increased travel around the globe, it would have received the point. 

b) The response earned the point because it identifies the Internet as a technology that emerged after the 
Second World War and explains that the Internet contributed to globalization by allowing people to learn 
“what is going on in the world in a few seconds.” 

c) The response did not earn the point because “modern science and medicine” is not a technology.
