0–7 Points 

1 Point 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  
•  The thesis must address at least two specific African responses to imperialism in  

a plausible fashion using evidence from the documents. 

•  Thesis statements such as “there were more reactions than actions” are not  

acceptable. 

•  Thesis statements that there were “positive and negative African reactions to”  

or “differing African views concerning” imperialism are not acceptable. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or in the specified conclusion  

of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple contiguous sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count as a point for meaning, evidence, or grouping. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of the documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 

•  Students must address all nine
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least eight

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of documents by  
grouping them with others that show a similar African reaction to imperialism. 
•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of the documents by accurately  

discussing European actions. 

•  Restating or quoting the content of the documents separately does not demonstrate  

an adequate understanding of meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document. 

2 Points  

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of an African response to imperialism must be  

explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of an African response to imperialism must be explicitly  

drawn from a minimum of seven

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 
•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two

 documents. 

1 Point 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular  
opinion or what particular feature informs the person’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description by considering and explaining the  
tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the  
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

o    Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but  
  must move beyond a mere statement of “bias” by providing some plausible analysis. 
o    Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information  

verbatim from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two ways.  
•  Students must explicitly and correctly group the documents in two ways
•  A minimum of two documents (used appropriately) constitutes a group or subgroup. 
•  Groupings must coherently address African responses to imperialism. Examples of such  

. 

1 Point 

groupings include: 
o  Violent resistance (Documents 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) 
o  Nonviolent/call for resistance (Documents 2, 6, 7, 8) 
o  Diplomacy/work with Europeans (Documents 1, 2, 3)  
o  Accommodation to European demands (Documents 1, 4, 6, 7) 
o  Resort to tradition or past ways (Documents 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) 

•  Documents grouped by “action and reaction,” location, or type of document are appropriate  

only if the student establishes a coherent and common African response for all  
documents within the group. 

6.  Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional  

 document or source.   

•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document or source and explain  

how it will contribute to the analysis of African responses to imperialism.

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.

•  The thesis correctly specifies BOTH continuity and change in patterns of 

interactions along the Silk Roads from 200 B.C.E. to 1450 C.E.

not acceptable. 

•  The thesis CANNOT count for any other point. 

2.   Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily evenly or  

thoroughly. 
For 2 points: 

•  Essay addresses BOTH continuity AND change in patterns of interactions along  

the Silk Roads with historically relevant specificity.

•  Provides at least four pieces of accurate evidence of continuity AND/OR change  

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 
o  Each piece of evidence must be a supporting example of continuity OR change  

in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads. 

4.   Uses relevant world historical context effectively to explain  

1 Point 

continuity and change over time. 

•  The essay relates or describes an extraregional connection or a global process to  
explain a continuity OR change in patterns of interactions along the Silk Roads.  
o  Example: “Over a period of time, Silk Roads were responsible for bringing different  

cultures into contact” is NOT acceptable because of the lack of specificity. 

•  Using “relevant world historical context” CANNOT count for the analysis point (#5).
