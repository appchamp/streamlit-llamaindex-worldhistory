Question 4: No Stimulus 

3  points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE  scientific or  technological  development that contributed  to the  
Green Revolution.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The development of chemical fertilizers was one contribution. 
•  Genetically modified crops and organisms (GMOs) contributed to the 

Green Revolution. 

•  The Green Revolution included new crop varieties that could survive in drier climates. 
•  A development was new equipment, such as tractors. 

(B) 

Explain ONE  way in which  the Green  Revolution benefited populations in  the developing 
world.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  By providing increased food crops, it prevented starvation and food shortages due to 

overpopulation. 

•  By increasing the availability of crops, it led to population growth. 
•  By providing new technologies that increased productivity, the Green Revolution 

allowed populations to pursue other economic activities. 

(C) 

Explain ONE  way in which  the Green  Revolution affected the environment within  the  
developing world.  

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

Increased use of fertilizers sometimes caused chemical runoff or pollution. 

• 
•  The increasing size of monoculture agriculture limited crop diversity and soil integrity 

in some cases. 

•  The spread of new technologies like tractors led to the industrialization of agriculture, 

which resulted in water and air pollution.

Short Answer Question 4 

Overview 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate understanding of the Green Revolution. In 
part A students were asked to identify a scientific or technological advancement that contributed to the 
Green Revolution. Part B required an explanation of how the innovations of the Green Revolution 
benefited populations in the developing world. Part C required responses that explained how the Green 
Revolution impacted the environment within the developing world. 

Sample: 4A 
Score:  3  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying pesticides as a technological development that 
contributed to the Green Revolution. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining “more accessibility to food in underdeveloped countries 
allowing population growth” as a way that the Green Revolution benefited populations in the 
developing world. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining that deforestation was one way that the Green 
Revolution affected the environment within the developing world. 

Sample: 4B 
Score:  2  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying GMOs as a key development during the Green 
Revolution. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining that the Green Revolution tech (GMO golden rice) 
provided more food and increased India’s population. 

c) The response did not earn the point because “new farming techniques” is too vague to be a 
creditable explanation. 

Sample: 4C 
Score:  1  

a) The response did not earn the point because it inaccurately identifies greenhouse gases as a 
development that contributed to the Green Revolution. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how “better agricultural output” led to an increase in 
population. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it fails to explain how the Green Revolution affected 
the environment.
