Question #1 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 1  
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Chinese Interactions with 
Nomads Image 
Mean Score: 0.49 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

This question addressed Key Concepts 2.2 and 3.2 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (The 
Development of States and Empires and Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and Their Interactions). This 
question presented students with an image of a Chinese general of the Tang dynasty interacting with Uighur 
nomads on the frontier of China. The students were then asked to identify and explain two continuities in Chinese 
imperial history based on the interaction depicted in the image. Further, students were asked to identify and explain 
one way in which the interaction between imperial China and Central Asian nomads changed after 1100 C.E. This 
question tested students’ ability to demonstrate and apply their knowledge of interactions between Chinese and 
Central Asian peoples. Even though the image is rooted in the Tang dynasty period (618–907 C.E.), students could 
draw on their knowledge of interactions between Chinese and Central Asian nomads in earlier periods, such as 
under the Han dynasty, or in later periods, such as under the Song and Ming dynasties. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Although many students performed well on this question, it proved to be the most difficult question of the four for 
students to successfully answer. Most students were able to identify a change in the interaction between imperial 
China and Central Asian nomads. Most frequently, they cited the Mongol conquest of China and the 
establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Students regularly cited continuities of interaction, including Chinese feelings 
of cultural superiority and their subsequent demand for respect and submission through the Chinese tributary 
system, which included nomadic peoples, and respectful relationships fostered by Confucian ideals. Students 
were more successful in their analysis of change as opposed to continuity. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Many students identified historical continuities and supporting evidence, but they were often not related to the 
interaction depicted in the image. Others correctly connected interactions in the image with historical processes 
but failed to note how those processes were continuities in Chinese imperial history. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

“Further, this image demonstrates another 
historical Chinese pattern: political 
manipulation. Confucian and legalist rulers 
alike were diligent at setting nomads against 
each other, so that China would be left alone.” 
(While a historically accurate statement, 
political manipulation is not shown in the 
image.) 

• 

“Another way in which the interaction depicts 
a continuity  in Chinese imperial history is that 
the Chinese often viewed themselves as 
ethnically, culturally, and socially superior to 
their nomadic counterparts. The painting 
shows the general looking down upon the 
Uighur nomads” (historically accurate and 
clearly illustrated in the image).

• 

“The nomads are giving themselves up to the 
might of China. The interaction between China 
and the nomads depicts how China moved and 
took over the lands of the Uighur.” (While the 
submission of the Uighurs to China is 
illustrated in the image, the student does not 
illustrate a historical continuity because the 
statement that China took over the Uighurs’ 
land is historically inaccurate.) 

“This image also represents the contentious 
relationship China had with nomads for its 
dynastic history. It was northern nomads that 
contributed to the fall of the Han and 
eventually the Song. …The tributary system is 
a symptom of this tumultuous relationship.” 
(The references to conflict between China and 
nomadic peoples during the Han and Song 
dynasties illustrates the connection between 
China and a continuity in Chinese history.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

The Short Answer Questions are new to the AP World History exam this year, and this style of question focuses on 
appropriate historical knowledge rather than an emphasis on a particular writing style or format. This style of 
response also requires the ability to demonstrate an understanding of historical context within the correct 
chronology and is based on the student’s content knowledge. 

Teachers should give their students opportunities to evaluate historical events through the use of historical 
images. They should work to develop interpretive skills addressing continuity and change over time. Teachers 
should also give their students practice writing brief responses that go beyond simply identifying historical events 
or processes. It is critical for students to understand how historical thinking skills require them to move beyond 
mere identification. 

Across all four SAQ questions, students were often very successful in identifying the appropriate historical 
interaction or example for the question being asked. Teachers can assist student performance by providing 
opportunities for students to explain interactions or examples analytically and focusing on how or why so that their 
response answers all aspects of the prompt.  

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the 
content and skill(s) required on this question? 

•  Teachers will find lessons on teaching the AP history disciplinary practice of analyzing historical evidence 
in the Teaching and Assessing Modules, a link to which is found on AP Central. There are modules that 
focus specifically on the disciplinary practice of analyzing historical evidence in conjunction with course 
content that is also often a challenge for students. This module contains specific lessons that address 
analyzing historical evidence, videos explaining instruction for this practice, and examples of assessments 
and student responses for tasks whose skill focus is analysis of historical evidence. 

•  The Teaching and Assessing Modules on AP Central also contain a number of additional examples of Short 

Answer Questions along with commentary and notes on scoring student work. 

•  Teachers will find example responses from this question on AP Central, along with specific commentary 

explaining why each point was or was not earned. 

•  The instructional section of the AP World History Course and Exam Description offers another collection of 
resources for teachers that address each of the specific skills needed for the course. The section beginning 
on page 151 specifically addresses the disciplinary practice of analyzing historical evidence and provides 
suggestions for instruction.

Question #2 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 2  
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Richards Land Use and 
Biodiversity Secondary Source  
Mean Score: 0.72 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

This question gave students the opportunity to address a broad range of historical content from the AP World 
History Curriculum Framework. Students’ responses could reference content from Key Concepts 1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 
4.1, 4.2, and/or 6.1 of the Curriculum Framework (The Neolithic Revolution and Early Agricultural Societies; 
Emergence of Interregional Networks of Communication and Exchange; Expansion and Intensification of 
Communication and Exchange Networks; Increased Economic Productive Capacity and Its Consequences; 
Globalizing Networks of Communication and Exchange; New Forms of Social Organization and Modes of 
Production; and/or Science and the Environment). This question presented students with a passage written by a 
historian who studies environmental history in the early modern period (1450−1750 C.E.). Students were asked to 
identify and explain a historically specific example of intensified human land use in that period that would support 
the author’s argument, one historically specific example of intensified human land use in the period before 1450 C.E. 
that would also support the author’s argument, and one late-twentieth-century development that explains the 
historian’s interest in the subject of the passage. The question tested students’ ability to comprehend the passage 
and then apply their understanding relative to the use of land in a historically meaningful way across three different 
time periods. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question appeared to be a more difficult question than Questions 3 and 4 but easier than Question 1 on the 
short answer portion of the exam. Most students were able to identify at least one aspect of the question and 
explain how that aspect was representative of the passage, thereby demonstrating their ability to utilize the 
historical thinking skills of contextualization and interpretation successfully. The most commonly cited historically 
specific examples for part a) were plantation agriculture, mining (if linked to land use), and slavery (also if linked to 
land use) during the Columbian Exchange and in European colonies in the Americas. Mesoamerican civilizations 
(e.g. the Aztecs with chinampas and the Incas with terraced agriculture) were also common. For part b) the most 
common responses included irrigation or the cultivation of cereal crops in river valley civilizations during the 
Neolithic Revolution. Students also discussed the three-field system in medieval Europe and improved plows and 
greater rice cultivation in Song dynasty China. For part c) reference to the Green Revolution, GMOs, and uses of 
pesticides and chemicals were common acceptable responses, as well as the environmental movement and global 
warming. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Many students identified a historically specific example but did not explain the link or impact of intensified human 
land use. For example, “trading crops and livestock” or “new crops being imported and exported to new places” 
are not directly related to land use or environmental impact. Others identified historical examples but outside the 
time period, such as the Industrial Revolution, the Dust Bowl, or the Irish potato famine. Also, the identification or 
explanation was either described in excessively vague terms or did not include enough detail; for example, “The 
start of agriculture led to population increase and the start of societies” (not linked to land use) or “agriculture is 
still around and how it is still interesting” (not linked to anything). Students also sometimes got sidetracked and 
described trade, economic factors, or population increases rather than concentrating on intensified human land 
use.

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

• 

“One key example to support the author’s 
claim would be the Columbian Exchange. This 
is one main example of intensified land use in 
the period 1450−1750 due to the fact of trading 
crops and livestock that happened.” (“Trading 
crops and livestock” is not specifically 
connected to land use.) 

“One example is the Irish Potato Famine. They  
overworked the land to a point where it would 
not yield crops.” (Although the student is 
illustrating an example of intensified land use, 
the example is outside the time period.) 

“Humans intensified land use in many ways, 
one way they did it through the time period 
before 1450 C.E. would be when they were 
really getting their agricultural systems 
together because you need land use when 
putting together a system to feed and water an 
amount of people.” (The evidence is too vague 
to be historically defensible.) 

• 

• 

• 

“The growth of plantation-style agriculture in 
European colonies supports the author’s 
argument. Plantation-style agriculture 
dedicated large amounts of land to the growth 
of a few major cash-crops such as sugar, 
cotton, and tobacco which significantly 
reduced the diversity in the vegetation” 
(clearly demonstrates the way in which 
plantation agriculture required intensified land 
use and connects the example to the  author’s 
argument). 

“When the Spanish and Portuguese conquered 
Latin America in the 1450−1750 C.E. period, 
they established sugar cane plantations there 
… As they only grew sugar cane, they  
purposely reduced the biodiversity” (an 
example of intensified land use within the time  
period). 

“During the Neolithic Revolution starting in 
8000  B.C.E. humans began expanding the use 
of agriculture, mostly around river valleys. 
Populations grew and so cultivation of crops 
such as wheat, rye, and barley dominated and  
reduced the variety of plant species.” (The 
response presents a specific example of 
intensified land use and demonstrates how the 
example is connected to the author’s 
argument.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Cross-period comparisons would be very helpful for students to improve their scores on Short Answer Questions. 
Students could also develop a stronger sense of periodization that would help improve their understanding of 
historical chronology. Practice at reading and analyzing different types of secondary sources, as well as writing 
responses to prompts derived from those sources, would be opportunities for students to improve the skills 
necessary to do well on SAQs, encourage historical thinking, and improve their critical reading and writing skills 
overall. In working with secondary sources, students should also be taught to contextualize contemporary 
historical writing.

Question #3 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 3  
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Industrialization as a Turning 
Point in Global History  
Mean Score: 0.77 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

This question addressed Key Concepts 5.1 and 5.2 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (Imperialism 
and Nation-State Formation and Nationalism, Revolution, and Reform). This question asked students to identify 
and explain three ways in which industrialization in the period circa 1750−1900 can be considered an economic 
turning point in global history: one economic, one political, and one social. The question assessed students’ ability to 
recognize how the process of industrialization had long-term consequences across the globe. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

This question was one of the highest performing questions in the Short Answer portion of the exam, and students 
often successfully demonstrated their ability to use the historical thinking skill of periodization. Many students 
were able to identify and explain at least one of the turning points. For part a) students frequently identified 
changes in global economic systems and explained how machine-based factory production led to greater, faster, 
and cheaper production of consumer goods, replacing older methods of production. For part b) many students 
identified that industrialization led to a greater need for raw materials and explained how the need for raw 
materials led to a wave of new imperialism that encompassed areas like Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, 
putting those areas under the political control of industrialized European nations for the first time. For part c) 
students frequently explained how women’s entry into the industrial working world helped pave the way for 
women’s rights movements that had largely been absent before industrialization. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Many students were able provide accurate factual information regarding economic, political, or social changes 
that resulted from industrialization but could not explain them as turning points in world history. Students also 
misidentified the nature of the turning points, incorrectly labeling them as economic, political, or social. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

“Industrialization in the 1750s through 1900s 
can be considered an economic turning point 
in global history because it brought wealth to 
the economy as factories were producing large  
quantities of goods to be  sold through trade.” 
(The response needs greater specificity and a  
clear explanation of how the changes alluded  
to constituted a turning point.) 

•  

•  

“Industrialization in the period 1750−1900 was 
the driving force behind creating a truly global 
economy. Factories in Europe produced 
manufactured goods desired by those in Africa 
and Asia, while provid[ing] raw materials like 
silk and porcelain. Africa had precious metals 
to trade for manufactured goods, while India 
traded cotton that could be made into textiles.” 
(a detailed response that explains how 
industrialization led to the creation of a truly 
global economy). 

“Industrialization was a shift from agriculture 
being a main source of economy to industrial 
powers and factories.” (a less detailed response 
that sufficiently explains why industrialization 
was a turning point).

• 

“Additionally, industrialization changed 
politics through the creation of free-market 
capitalism in many developed nations.” (The 
explanation for this response does not clearly 
demonstrate how the emergence of free-
market capitalism was a political turning 
point.) 

• 

“It led to the expanding economic growth of 
Europe and the western economy. This push 
for countries to become industrial 
powerhouses also pushed nations to find 
countries to exploit for their raw materials. This 
led to massive imperialism in the southeast of 
Asia, Indo-China, and India.” (This response 
provides a specific of European imperialism to 
illustrate a political turning point.) 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers should provide their students opportunities to analyze historical processes beyond their short-term 
effects, focusing also on the long-term impact of those processes and what makes them so important. Teachers 
should also emphasize the difference between identification and explanation. An explanation should address the 
analytical questions of how or why. Students should also develop and retain content knowledge through the 
instructional provision of coherent frameworks of periodization aligned with the specific course themes. Teachers 
should also encourage students to see the connection between the analysis of continuity and change and that of 
periodization. 

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the 
content and skill(s) required on this question? 

•  Teachers will find lessons on teaching the skills associated with the Short Answer Questions located on

Question #4 

Task: Short Answer 
Question 4  
Max. Points: 3 

Topic: Three Technologies Leading to 
Globalization   
Mean Score: * 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

This question addressed Key Concepts 6.1 and 6.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (Science and 
the Environment and New Conceptualizations of Global Economy, Society, and Culture). This question asked 
students to identify three technologies that have contributed to globalization since the end of the Second World War 
and explain how each one contributed to globalization. Students earned 1 point for each technology that was 
identified and for explaining how that technology contributed to globalization. This question tested students’ ability 
to understand causal relationships between technology and globalization and apply specific evidence in support of 
those interpretations, given the timeline provided. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students performed well on this question. Most students were able to identify at least two technologies that have 
contributed to globalization. Many students also supplied a clear causal explanation of how that technology 
contributed to globalization. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Most students were able to identify innovations or expanded use of technology for the time period, but some 
struggled with placing their identifications within the time period asked for in the question. Many successfully 
discussed some of the opportunities that new technologies presented, but the most common student omission 
was connecting increased access to technology to the phenomenon of globalization. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

• 

• 

“A second technology that has contributed to 
globalization since the end of the Second 
World War is the telephone. This is because 
the telephone allowed for easy communication 
between leaders in different parts of the 
world.” (The invention and extensive use of the 
telephone preceded the Second World War.) 

“Second, the development of efficient airlines. 
Airplanes aren’t new but they certainly are 
more accessible. This … helped move more 
people and products.” (The connection  
between more efficient airlines and 
globalization is not clearly explained.) 

• 

• 

“One technology that has contributed  to 
globalization since the end of the Second 
World War is the television. This is because the 
television is an integral part of broadcasting 
major events to the entire world. This made it 
easier for all countries to be aware of  each 
other and current events, which contributed to 
globalization.” (The invention of the television 
occurred following the Second World War and 
the response clearly explains how the 
television contributed to globalization.) 

“Another technology that has contributed to 
globalization is music players such as the MP3 
player, the Walkman, or  cassette players. All of 
these innovations have served to spread 
music, and thereby the cultures associated 
with them, across the globe.” (Clear 
explanation of how technology has contributed 
to globalization by spreading culture.)

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Causation is one of the historical reasoning skills of the curriculum. Teachers are clearly covering new 
technologies and globalization, and should continue doing so, while emphasizing the impact of new technologies 
throughout history. Teachers should provide students with conceptual frameworks and substantive concepts to 
promote more sophisticated thinking about causation, such as analyzing the relative significance of multiple, or 
short- and long-term, causes and/or effects.

Question #1 

Task: Document-Based 
Question   
Max. Points: 7 

Topic: Religious and State Responses to 
Wealth Accumulation  
Mean Score: 1.44 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on historical 
documents. This DBQ asked students to evaluate the extent to which states and religions differed in their views 
regarding wealth accumulation in both the classical and post-classical eras. The question addressed Key Concepts 
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (The Development and Codification of 
Religious and Cultural Traditions; The Development of States and Empires; Emergence of Interregional Networks of 
Communication and Exchange; Expansion and Intensification of Communication and Exchange Networks; 
Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and Their Interactions; and Increased Economic Productive Capacity and 
Its Consequences). The seven documents provided students with opportunities to examine both religious views of 
wealth accumulation (with documents representing Confucian, Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist views) and state 
views of wealth accumulation (with documents representing Warring States China, the Mauryan Empire, the Roman 
Empire, and a thirteenth-century South Indian kingdom). As part of their responses, students had to present a 
historically defensible thesis; develop a cohesive argument that accounts for the historical complexities of the 
question; utilize the content of at least six documents in support of the thesis or a relevant argument; explain the 
significance of authorial purpose, point of view, the document’s historical context, or its intended audience for at 
least four documents; situate the argument in a broader historical context; provide at least one example of specific 
evidence not mentioned in the documents to support or qualify the argument; and extend the argument by either 
connecting it to a different course theme or another discipline or by comparing it to developments in other regions or 
time periods. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

The 2017 DBQ proved challenging as it included new elements (synthesis, context, and outside evidence) and no 
longer assessed the grouping of documents or the request for additional documents. Some teachers were not 
aware of changes to the DBQ, and some students, for example, continued to address the need for an additional 
document. Moreover, the new DBQ rubric demanded considerably more from old components. Higher thresholds 
were demanded for the sourcing of documents (four instead of two), and students no longer received points for 
simply addressing documents. In addition, the question stem was new and unfamiliar. 

Students did fairly well articulating thesis statements for a very complex prompt that required an assessment of “to 
what extent” religious responses differed from state responses to wealth accumulation. Many students were able to 
make a historically defensible claim that responded to all parts of the question.  

While many students were successful in utilizing at least six documents to support their argument, a significant 
number struggled to achieve this. This challenge seemed partially related to the complexity of the documents that 
often evidenced multiple responses to wealth accumulation as well as the new prompt language. 

Argument development seemed to be the least awarded point. Many students struggled to identify a variety of state 
and religious responses. Many students still wrote essays that addressed the documents in numeric order and did 
not put the documents in conversation with each other. 

Sourcing four documents was difficult for many students. A large number of students stated “the purpose of this doc 
is …” but failed to explain the significance of that purpose. This phenomenon was true for all four types of sourcing 
(point of view, purpose, audience, and historical context). 

Most students were not successful in contextualizing the topic. Most students did not attempt Synthesis or Evidence 
Beyond the documents.

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Students often failed to earn the sourcing point because they did not explain the significance for the example of 
the purpose or historical context that informed the creation of the document. Students who did not earn the thesis 
point often did not do so because they failed to address “the extent to which” religious and state responses to 
wealth accumulation differed.

Student states the purpose of the document 
without explaining its significance: “The 
purpose of the Chronicle of Zhuo was written 
to show that they were allowing free trade to 
grant peace.” 

Thesis fails to address “the extent to which” 
and thus not all components of the question: 
“From 600 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. state responses 
differed greatly from religious responses to 
wealth accumulation.”

Student uses context to  explain significance: 
“The Zhou document outlines a pact between 
rulers and merchants to ensure that as long as 
merchants do not revolt their rights will be 
protected. While the source is reflective of the 
Warring States Period in China, one of a lack of 
political order, the covenant between rulers 
and merchants illustrates that stability of the 
state of the state greatly overpowered the 
individual pursuits of citizens.” 

“While both state responses and religious 
responses were largely negative, state 
responses were comparatively more so based 
on the premise that wealth accumulation 
would lead to instability in the empire. On the 
other hand, religious responses see a more 
pronounced emphasis on charity, goodness 
and an appeal to spirituality.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

In order to achieve argument development, teachers should explain to students the importance of clearly 
articulating their arguments. Students would benefit from specific tools/tips to achieve this, including: analytical 
topic sentences that articulate subclaims, putting documents in conversation with each other in order to support 
subclaims, and including words that make and explain connections between those documents such as corroborate 
or qualify as found in the DBQ rubric. 

Students need training and practice in utilizing primary sources in relation to a complex prompt. Teachers should 
provide students with scaffolded activities with small numbers of documents to practice using the documents as 
evidence to substantiate claims and assertions relative to a specific prompt. Students struggled to relate both the 
given documents and attempted “evidence beyond the documents” to their argument in relation to this complex 
DBQ prompt. Students can only learn this if they are given tasks of similar difficulty in the classroom in formative 
settings where they receive constructive feedback. 

Teachers should also consider using SAQs with one or two documents to prompt and scaffold students to better 
‘source’ documents by demonstrating the significance of the audience, purpose, or historical context associated 
with the primary source. 

Teachers should also consider presenting content to students framed around coherent substantive concepts 
associated with global historical processes such as ‘patriarchy,’ ‘migration’ or ‘colonialism’ and do so purposefully 
within specific time periods. This will support students situating the topic of the essay within a larger global

process, perhaps in the period preceding that of the question, and provide the opportunity to earn the 
contextualization point. 

On a regular basis teachers should implement short classroom activities that challenge students to provide an 
additional example of a historical development beyond that found in a small number of documents and in response 
to a specific point. This will improve students’ ability to earn the outside evidence point.  

What resources would you recommend to teachers to better prepare their students for the 
content and skill(s) required on this question? 

•  Teachers will find lessons on teaching the disciplinary practices and the historical reasoning skills 

associated with the DBQ in the Teaching and Assessing Modules, a link to which is found on AP Central. 
These modules contain specific lessons that address instruction of DBQ skills, including analyzing 
historical evidence, argument development, and contextualization. Additional materials can be found on 
AP Central in conjunction with related course content, as well as examples of assessments and student 
responses for tasks whose skill focus relates to the DBQ. 

•  The Teaching and Assessing Modules also contain resources focused specifically on scoring responses on 
DBQs using the AP World history scoring rubric. The focus on assessment found in the Teaching and 
Assessing Modules offers insights into how to address document-based-question skills. This includes 
examples and commentary on what earned points and what did not for tasks whose primary skill focus is 
related to DBQ skills.  

•  Teachers will find example responses from this question on AP Central, along with specific commentary 

explaining why each point was or was not earned. 

•  The Online Teacher Community is a good resource for teachers to seek additional feedback and support 
from peers by posting a question or comment in the discussion section, or by checking what resources 
have already been posted in the “resources” tab on the Online Teacher Community. 

•  The instructional section of the AP World History Course and Exam Description offers another collection of 
resources for teachers that address each of the specific skills needed for the course. The section on page

Question #2 

Task: Long Essay 
Question  
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: Continuities and Changes in  
Labor Migrations, 1450−1750 C.E.  
Mean Score: 1.07 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ knowledge of continuties and changes in patterns of labor 
migration in the period between 1450 and 1750 C.E. This content is part of Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of the AP 
World History Curriculum Framework (Globalizing Networks of Communication and Exchange; New Forms of Social 
Organization and Modes of Production; and State Consolidation and Imperial Expansion). The question’s geographic 
scope was global, and its choronological scope encompassed the period of new large-scale mass migrations from 
Afro-Eurasia to the Americas that followed the Age of Exploration, as well as the continuation of previous patterns of 
labor migrations, such as intra-Africa slavery, slave trade networks in the Muslim World, and global rural-to-urban 
migration movements. The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their knowledge of multiple 
types of labor migrations, including involuntary migration (slavery, indentured servitude) and voluntary migration (for 
economic, religious, or political reasons). Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe 
both a historical continuity and a historical change in labor migrations during this period, explain the reasons for the 
historical continuity and the reasons for the historical change, address the topic with specific examples of relevant 
evidence, deploy the evidence to fully and effectively substantiate the thesis or a relevant argument, and extend the 
argument by either connecting it to a different course theme or another discipline or by comparing it to 
developments in other time periods. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Students struggled with this question. Only 40 percent of students chose to answer the first LEQ (Question 2 on 
the exam), and this cohort also performed significantly worse on the multiple-choice component of the exam. 
Students who chose Question 2 overwhelmingly developed essays that addressed the forced migration of Africans 
to the Americas within the Atlantic slave trade. Students were very well versed in this topic, demonstrating their 
knowledge with extensive specific evidence germane to the topic and often in support of the Atlantic slave trade 
as a change or continuity in labor migration. The Atlantic slave trade was accepted as either a change (which was 
introduced with the colonization of the Americas) or a continuity (the transatlantic slave trade began with the 
Portuguese use of African slave labor on African Atlantic islands in the mid-fifteenth century), but it could not be 
used in the same essay as both. Students also did an excellent job substantiating arguments about the reasons for 
the transatlantic slave trade through well-developed explanations that included reference to the impact of disease 
and the formation of encomienda, plantation, and extractive economies. Aside from the Atlantic system, some 
students successfully introduced rural to urban labor migrations as a change associated with the Agricultural 
Revolution on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. 

Many students struggled on this question because they did not recognize that the Atlantic slave trade — while 
involuntary — was a labor migration. The majority of students who did recognize and articulate the Atlantic slave 
trade as a change or continuity could not identify or explain another labor migration to juxtapose as a continuity or 
change. The inability to identify and explain a change and continuity meant students could not earn the thesis point 
or both the historical argumentation points. Moreover, many students addressed changes and continuity in labor 
systems or organizations but not labor migration. Lastly, the majority of students did not attempt the synthesis point 
in their essays. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Students struggled with meeting the specificity of the prompt and the much higher expectations of the 2017 
rubric. Very few students earned the thesis point as the rubric demanded that it address all aspects of the 
question that in this case called students to both identify and explain both continuity and change in labor 
migrations. Even if a student could identify a continuity and change in the thesis statement, few could introduce 
some element of ‘explain’ while doing so. As noted, most students could not identify or describe, let alone explain,

both a change and continuity. Unlike in the previous year, in 2017 students did not have the opportunity to earn at 
least 1 point (out of 2 points) for knowing one or the other. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding

No explanatory element in the thesis: “The 
continuity of the labor migration was the slave  
trade in the  period 1450−1750. However, a 
significant change was that unlike in the 
1450s, in the 1750s the peasant classes in 
Europe made internal migrations to major 
cities.” 

Fails to identify and explain a continuity in 
labor migration: “Labor migration in 1450−1750  
took a drastic shift. As the Age of Exploration  
began in the 1450s, Europeans established 
plantations and the need for slaves developed. 
Sparked by the Columbian Exchange  and the 
impact of disease on Native Americans, 
Europeans brought slaves from Africa … the 
continuity was the use of labor through the 
encomienda and mita system.” 

“African slaves were continually being  
migrated to the Americas to work on 
plantation sites by Europeans. A change in 
labor migration during this period was the 
movement of rural people  from rural places to 
urban areas to take part in manufacturing 
labor.”  

“A significant change in labor migration was 
the intensification in labor migrations of 
African slaves that were forcefully sent to 
plantations in the Americas where labor was 
needed and Native Americans were dying off 
… A significant continuity in labor migration 
through most of the period was the use of 
indentured servants throughout the period and  
especially in the settler colonies in North 
America where labor was used that was too 
poor to pay their transport on their own.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers need to teach to the curriculum as informed by the AP World History Course and Exam Description as 
opposed to the detailed textbook. The content of the course needs to be present in learning frames that generate 
spatial, temporal, and conceptual coherence (e.g., through the substantive concept of migration) for students to 
more effectively build (and remember) their content knowledge of world historical development.  

Students also need to be encouraged to write to the prompt. Teachers should move away from teaching students 
to write in prescribed categories (SPEC, SPRITES, SPICE, etc.), and instead focus on developing historical thinking 
skills and applying them to historical writing. Continued emphasis should be placed on thesis development, 
prewriting strategies, and overall structural organization of the essay. Prewriting in particular stands out as an 
area for teachers to address, since many students seemed to run out of time on the LEQ, ending in mid-sentence 
or even saying “I ran out of time” on the page. Taking a few minutes to outline or plan both the DBQ and LEQ 
would probably help students to develop both essays more specifically within the time period. Students need more 
practice on the LEQ, and they do not always need to write time-consuming full essays for teachers to monitor the 
development of their performance on this assessment type. For example, students can produce a graphic organizer 
in response to a LEQ prompt where they state their thesis, topic sentences and assertions, bullet evidence, and 
briefly explain how they would explain continuity and change. These graphic organizers are relatively easy to 
grade, target appropriate feedback to students aligned to the rubric, and also scaffold prewriting strategies for the 
exam.

Question #3 

Task: Long Essay 
Question  
Max. Points: 6 

Topic: Continuities and Changes in  
Global Balance of Power since 1900  
Mean Score: 1.37 

What were responses expected to demonstrate in their response to this question? 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ knowledge of continuities and changes in the global balance of 
political power in the period from 1900 C.E. to the present. This content is part of Key Concepts 6.2 and 6.3 of the AP 
World History Curriculum Framework (Global Conflicts and Their Consequences and New Conceptualizations of 
Global Economy, Society, and Culture). The question covered a broad scope of course content and allowed students 
to demonstrate their knowledge of twentieth-century political history in relationship to the concept of global balance 
of power. To succeed in the question students had to clearly identify both a continuity and a change. Successful 
answers had to address at least one continuity across most of the century (for example, reliance on alliances and 
coalitions, continued dominance of the West, continued disparities in economic and military power between 
developed and developing areas, etc.) and at least one significant change in the period (for example, the rise and fall 
of the Soviet Union, the collapse of European colonial empires, the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, etc.) Some historical 
developments during the period, for instance, the role of the United States in the global balance of power, could be 
presented as either continuities or changes, depending on the direction of the student’s argument. Students had to 
present a historically defensible thesis, describe both a historical continuity and a historical change in the global 
balance of power during this period, explain the reasons for the historical continuity and the reasons for the historical 
change, address the topic with specific examples of relevant evidence, deploy the evidence to fully and effectively 
substantiate the thesis or a relevant argument, and extend the argument by either connecting it to a different course 
theme or another discipline or by comparing it to developments in other time periods. 

How well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did 
the responses integrate the skills required on this question? 

Sixty percent of students chose to answer the second LEQ (Question 3 on the exam), and this cohort also 
performed significantly better on the multiple-choice component of the exam. Students demonstrated significant 
content knowledge of the twentieth century, particularly about the world wars and the Cold War, so they generally 
provided answers that were on task on this question. Some were quite lengthy. Students had success meeting the 
lower skills points such as argument development (describe) and using evidence (examples), but they struggled 
more with the more sophisticated historical skills such as explanation and substantiation. A few students wrote 
sophisticated analyses of the turbulence of the past century in the context of the continuity of Cold War conflicts. 
Many spoke of the continuity of the United States’ role as a superpower, and many also described the fall of the 
Soviet Union as an important shift in global power. Students who focused on the first half of the century had 
greater difficulty describing and explaining both change and continuity. 

If students could not identify and explain a change and continuity that meant they could not earn the thesis point 
or both the historical argumentation points. Moreover, many students wrote essays about economic power 
(industrialization, technology) or about ideologies (capitalism, democracy), and only some of the students were 
able to link those concepts to global balance of political power. 

What common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this 
question? 

Another common error was the omission of the continuity, so some essays entirely focused on changes. Finally, 
students often failed to make the connection to one or more pieces of the prompt, such as “global” or “political,” in 
their writing. 

Students struggled with meeting the specificity of the prompt and the much higher expectations of the rubric in 
2017. Very few students earned the thesis point as the rubric demanded that it address all aspects of the question, 
which in this case called students to both identify and explain both continuity and change in labor migrations. Even 
if a student could identify a continuity and change in the thesis statement few could introduce some element of 
‘explain’ while doing so. Most students could not identify or describe, let alone explain, both a change and

continuity. Unlike in the previous year, in 2017 students did not have the opportunity to earn at least 1 point (out of 2 
points) for knowing one or the other. 

Common Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps 

Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  

•  Does not contain an explanatory element in the 
thesis: “In relation to continuity from 1900 the 
West is still a significant power. However since 
WWII the US and Russia increased in power as 
well as China more recently.” 

•  Fails to identify and explain both a continuity 
and change in the global balance of power: 
“Throughout the 20th  century, war was a 
continuous experience from the first and 
second world wars, followed by the Korean and 
Vietnam Wars to the war on terrorism today … 
the creation of nuclear warheads had  a 
significant impact on promoting the USA and 
USSR as superpowers after World War II.” 

• 

• 

“From 1900 the U.S. grew steadily through 
industrial and military expansion and 
continued to be a global power. In the same 
timeframe, China transformed itself from a 
failing empire to a global power based on a 
growing economy.” 

“Throughout the 1900s the US has been a 
dominant global power. During WWI US 
economic support was key to the defeat of 
Germany. During WWII the US proved itself as 
a military power and developed the atom 
power and remained dominant during and 
after the Cold War … A significant change in 
global power is the recent emergence of China 
on the basis of its expanding manufacturing 
from outsourcing from the West.” 

Based on your experience at the AP® Reading with student responses, what advice would you 
offer to teachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? 

Teachers may want to consider increasing their focus on specificity for all of the scoring points. For instance, in 
the thesis, students often successfully conceived of a change and a continuity without being able to clearly name 
or identify their parameters, so teachers may want to practice that skill with students. Another place where 
students lost points in the essays was in Argument Development — Explanation, so teachers might consider 
having students practice writing a summary sentence at the end of the paragraph that discusses the reason for 
the change/continuity, the cause of that change/continuity, or the larger significance of that change/continuity. 

Teachers need to teach to the curriculum as informed by the AP World History Course and Exam Description as 
opposed to the detailed textbook. The content of the course needs to be present in learning frames that generate 
spatial, temporal, and conceptual coherence (e.g., through the substantive concept of migration) for students to 
more effectively build (and remember) their content knowledge of world historical development. Given the wealth 
of relevant material in the second half of the twentieth century to answer this question, teachers do their students 
a disservice if they do not complete the curriculum. 

Continued emphasis should be placed on thesis development, prewriting strategies, and overall structural 
organization of the essay. Prewriting in particular stands out as an area for teachers to address, since many 
students seemed to run out of time on the LEQ, ending in mid-sentence or even saying “I ran out of time” on the 
page. Taking a few minutes to outline or plan both the DBQ and LEQ would probably help students to develop 
both essays more specifically within the time period. Students need more practice on the LEQ, and they do not 
always need to write time-consuming full essays for teachers to monitor the development of their performance on 
this assessment type. For example, students can produce a graphic organizer in response to a LEQ prompt where 
student state their thesis, topic sentences and assertions, bullet evidence, and briefly explain how they would 
explain continuity and change. These graphic organizers are relatively easy to grade, target appropriate feedback 
to students aligned to the rubric, and also scaffold prewriting strategies for the exam.
