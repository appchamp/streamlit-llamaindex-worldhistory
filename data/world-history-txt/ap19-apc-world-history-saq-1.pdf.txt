Short Answer Question 1 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt 
on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had 
an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their 
primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of 
numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange. 

Indeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian 
exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed at 
center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have seen, 
pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and West [in 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].” 

Thomas Allsen, historian, Culture and Conquest, 2001

a) Identify ONE specific historical example of a cultural exchange between nomads and non-nomads that 
occurred in the period before 1450. 

b) For the period 1450–1750 C.E., identify ONE development that changed the role that Central Asian nomads 
played in cross-regional exchanges as described in the passage. 

c) Explain ONE cross-cultural exchange that would challenge the assertion in the last sentence of the passage 
concerning the nomads’ role in cross-regional exchanges before 1450.

Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying one specific historical example of a cultural exchange between nomads and 

non-nomads that occurred in the period before 1450 

•  ONE point for identifying one development in the period 1450–1750 C.E. that changed the role that 

Central Asian nomads played in cross-regional exchanges as described in the passage 

•  ONE point for explaining one cross-cultural exchange that would challenge the assertion in the last 
sentence of the passage concerning the nomads’ role in cross-regional exchanges before 1450 

Scoring Notes 

General notes to raters: 

•  Students are responding to the question with a variety of examples of nomadic peoples and cultural 

exchanges and interactions between nomadic and non-nomadic peoples that may or may not appear in 
college or high school textbooks. We encourage all raters to use any materials necessary to verify the 
accuracy of any such examples before scoring the response. 

•  We ask that you use a broad interpretation of “nomad” to include groups such as the Mongols that 
were nomadic but created empires and used the institutions and traditions of sedentary societies to 
govern their empires. This interpretation also pertains to groups such as the Arabs, which included 
both nomadic and sedentary peoples and also included nomads who eventually settled down and 
became sedentary. 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  Cultural exchanges between nomads and non-nomads included the spread of stirrups and gunpowder. 
•  Contact with nomadic peoples led the Song dynasty of China to use warhorses from Central Asia. 
•  The spread of religions such as Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, or Zoroastrianism across Central Asia 

in the period before 1450 was facilitated by contact between nomadic and non-nomadic societies along 
the Silk Roads. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  The decline of the importance of the Silk Roads changed the role of Central Asian nomads. 
•  The expansion of gunpowder empires, such as Russia and the Qing dynasty, led to the declining 

importance of Central Asian nomads in facilitating cross-regional exchange. 

•  European settlement of the Americas led to the declining importance of Central Asian nomads in cross-
regional exchanges because trans-Atlantic contact became more important to global economic and 
cultural exchange.  

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Christianity was mostly spread by merchants and missionaries who came from sedentary societies. 
•  The spread of technologies like the compass or papermaking would challenge Allsen’s claim that 
nomads were the chief promoters and agents of cultural exchange in Eurasia before 1450 because 
papermaking spread from China. 

•  Greek culture, philosophy, and science greatly influenced the development of Roman society, which 
challenges Allsen’s argument that nomads were the chief agents of cultural exchange in the period 
before 1450.

2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 1 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were prompted to interpret an argument from a secondary source and 
to identify or explain examples of cultural exchange between nomads and non-nomads that occurred before 
1450, which could be religious, linguistic, or technological in nature. In addition, students were to identify one 
development that changed the role of Central Asian nomads in cross-regional exchanges in the period 1450–
1750 C.E., typically expressed as a consequence of improvements in maritime technology and trade that 
diminished the role of nomads. Lastly, students were to explain one cross-cultural exchange before 1450 that 
would challenge the statement in the last sentence of the passage, which claims that pastoral nomads were the 
chief instigators and promoters of exchange between East and West before 1450. The question addressed Key 
Concepts 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework, the historical reasoning skill of 
Contextualization, and the disciplinary practice of Analyzing Historical Evidence (secondary sources). 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the fact that the Mongols facilitated the spread of gunpowder. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying the fact that the expansion of maritime trade in the Indian Ocean 
basin reduced the importance of Central Asian nomads in cross-regional exchanges because nomads did 
not have direct access to the maritime networks. 

c) The response earned 1 point for its discussion of how non-nomadic Arab merchants spread Arabic 

numerals. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the fact that the Mongols helped spread Turkic languages 

and customs in Eurasia. 

b) The response did not earn the point because the Mongols “reopening” of the Silk Road occurred outside of 

the specified time period 1450–1750. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that non-nomadic Muslim merchants helped spread Islam 

to India.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because the Mongols did not introduce the saddle to Europe. 

b) The response did not earn the point because the expansion of the Mongol Empire and its effect on Silk Road 

trade are out of the specified time period 1450–1750. 

c) The response earned 1 point for discussing Byzantine trade with Africa and India in the period before 1450.
