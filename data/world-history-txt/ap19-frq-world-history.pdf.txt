WORLD HISTORY 

SECTION I, Part B 

Time—40 minutes 

Directions: Answer Question 1 and Question 2. Answer either Question 3 or Question 4. 

Write your responses in the Section I, Part B: Short-Answer Response booklet. You must write your response to each 
question on the lined page designated for that response. Each response is expected to fit within the space provided. 

In your responses, be sure to address all parts of the questions you answer. Use complete sentences; an outline or 
bulleted list alone is not acceptable. You may plan your answers in this exam booklet, but no credit will be given for 
notes written in this booklet. 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“Inner [and Central] Asia have long been seen as a zone of contact and transmission, a lengthy conveyor belt 
on which commercial and cultural wares traveled between the major civilizations of Eurasia. The nomads had 
an essential but largely unacknowledged role in this cultural traffic. While nomadic empires had as their 
primary objective the control and exploitation of sedentary subjects, their secondary effect was the creation of 
numerous opportunities for cross-cultural contact, comparison, and exchange. 

Indeed, although nomads are normally included in the analysis of the political context of trans-Eurasian 
exchange, they are typically left out of the cultural equation. Here the great sedentary civilizations are placed 
at center stage, particularly when scientific and cultural transfers are under consideration. But, as we have 
seen, pastoral nomads were the chief initiators, promoters, and agents of this exchange between East and 
West [in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries].”

Thomas Allsen, historian, Culture and Conquest, 2001 

1.  a) Identify ONE specific historical example of a cultural exchange between nomads and non-nomads that 

occurred in the period before 1450. 

b) For the period 1450–1750 C.E., identify ONE development that changed the role that Central Asian nomads 
played in cross-regional exchanges as described in the passage. 

c) Explain ONE cross-cultural exchange that would challenge the assertion in the last sentence of the passage 
concerning the nomads’ role in cross-regional exchanges before 1450.

Document 1 

Source: Advice given in 1500 by the Muslim merchants of Calicut to the Hindu ruler of Calicut concerning 
the arrival of the second Portuguese expedition to the city. Recorded in the History of the Discovery and 
Conquest of India by the Portuguese by Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, a Portuguese historian, published in 
1551. 

Your Majesty: we are astonished that you should lower yourself by receiving these Portuguese enemies into 
your kingdom, who seem to be pirates rather than merchants. We, your Muslim subjects, have always been 
loyal to you and have brought valuable foreign merchandise to this country and have exported its native 
products to increase your revenue greatly. You appear to forget all this, by receiving those newcomers into 
your favor as if your own numerous and faithful subjects were incompetent for the purpose. In this you 
dishonor yourself, and embolden these strangers to hold your power in contempt. 

The true intent of the Portuguese in coming into these seas is to take possession of your city, and not to trade 
for spices as they pretend. The place you have given them for a trading post, they will convert into a fort, 
from where they will make war on you when you least expect it. We say these things to you out of good will 
rather than out of any desire for profit; for if you do not listen to our advice, there are other cities on India’s 
Malabar Coast from which we can conduct our trade in spices. 

Document 2 

Source: Duarte Barbosa, government official employed in a Portuguese trading-post on the Malabar Coast, 
travel narrative published in Portugal in 1516. 

The Muslims in Calicut are rich, and live well, and they used to control all the sea trade from that town. 
Indeed, if the king of Portugal had not discovered India, Malabar would already have been in the hands of the 
Muslims. 

In addition to the local Muslims, there are also foreign Muslims in Calicut such as Arabs, Persians, and 
Gujaratis. They are great merchants, sail to all parts of the world with their goods, and have their own 
Muslim leader who rules over them and disciplines them as necessary, without the Hindu king of Calicut 
meddling with them. And before the king of Portugal discovered the country, the Muslim traders were so 
numerous and powerful in the city of Calicut that the Hindus did not dare to enter into disputes with them. 

And after the king of Portugal made himself master there, and these Muslims saw that they could not defend 
their position there, they began to leave Calicut, so that very few of them remain today.

Document 3 

Source: Anonymous Portuguese court official’s letter of advice to King Sebastian of Portugal regarding a 
proposal to conclude a peace treaty and establish free trade with the Ottoman Empire, mid-1560s. 

If the Turks were allowed to travel freely to India, and establish their own trading-posts, and trade in 
merchandise wherever they wished, Your Majesty’s own profits would suffer greatly. If that were to happen, 
all of the business handled by our merchants would immediately fall to the Turks because their empire is 
much closer to India. The duration of their voyages, their transportation costs, the risks they would face, and 
the damage they would sustain to their ships and their merchandise would be less than half of that suffered by 
our own ships. 

Portugal’s state monopoly in pepper and other controlled spices would also be threatened by allowing the 
Turks to establish trade in India. Even now, when they have not been able to openly compete against us, it is 
known that they conduct trade in secret, carrying spices to Persia, Bengal, Southeast Asia, and China, and 
especially to their own markets, despite our efforts to stop them. 

Thus, if the Turks are allowed to operate freely, their ties with local Muslims would make them even better 
informed and better organized than us, so that they could send as much pepper as they wanted by means of 
the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and become masters of the lion’s share of the trade in spices. 

Document 4 

Source: Alauddin Riayat Syah al-Kahar, ruler of the Sultanate of Aceh, a Muslim state on the island of 
Sumatra, Indonesia, letter to the Ottoman sultan Suleiman I, 1566. 

It is our firm belief that if your Majesty better understood the circumstances of Aceh and our long struggle 
against the miserable Portuguese infidels, your Imperial compassion would be awakened. As you know, the 
pilgrim and merchant vessels from all the ports of Indonesia must pass through the Maldive Islands on their 
way to Mecca and the Red Sea, and between all 24,000 Maldive Islands, there are just four channels where a 
ship can pass safely. The infidel Portuguese wait around the entrances of these channels. When our ships 
arrive there, the Portuguese stop and take possession of as many as they can. Any ship they cannot capture 
they sink with cannon fire, either leaving the Muslims aboard to drown, or capturing and enslaving them. 

The Portuguese have even dared attack Ottoman ships belonging to your Majesty. For example, in the year 
1565, your officials came to Aceh and left for Istanbul loaded with pepper, silk, cinnamon, cloves, and other 
products from Indonesia. Portuguese vessels intercepted the ship at the Maldives and sank it. Five hundred 
Muslims drowned and the rest were enslaved. 

So, we request that your Imperial Majesty grant us siege cannons and ask that you instruct the Ottoman 
governors of Egypt and Aden to allow our representatives to come to your Majesty’s illustrious court and 
obtain all the horses, armor, and other weapons that we will need for our defense against the Portuguese.

Document 5 

Source: Zainudeen Makhdoom Al Sageer, Muslim religious scholar and historian from Calicut, southern 
India, address to southern Indian Muslims, written circa 1570. 

After the Portuguese had established themselves in Cochin on the Malabar Coast, they forced every vessel, 
however small, to carry a safe conduct pass, which was issued for a certain fee. The Portuguese, in imposing 
this toll, claimed that it would improve commerce. To enforce the toll, they seized the cargo and crew of any 
ship that did not have its pass! 

In addition to this system of persecution, the Portuguese deployed ships all over the Indian Ocean to lie in 
wait and intercept vessels. In this way, they unjustly acquired vast wealth and captured countless prisoners. 

Soon, as a result of his lengthy conflict with the Portuguese, the ruler of our city of Calicut almost entirely 
exhausted his treasure and resources and his kingdom became strained to the limit. Because he was tired of 
war, the prince entered into a treaty in 1515 allowing the Portuguese to build a fort in Calicut in exchange for 
allowing his subjects to send four ships every year to Arabian ports. Afterward, the Portuguese set about 
building their fortifications, while the merchants of Calicut prepared four ships loaded with pepper and 
ginger for dispatch to the Arabian coast and, at the same time, resumed trading with Gujarat and other foreign 
ports while carrying with them the passes from the Portuguese.

Document 6 

Source: Cesare Federici, Venetian trader, The Voyage and Travel to East India, published in Venice, 1587. 

In the city of Cambay in northwestern India, Hindu brokers of great authority have traditionally handled all 
transactions at the port, and the Portuguese merchants observe this custom. Every foreign merchant who does 
business in the country has his own broker who works with him in buying and selling his merchandise. When 
a new fleet of ships sails into port at Cambay, the brokers come to the dock and the foreign merchants give 
them all their cargo. The merchants carefully note all the bundles and packs of goods that they are giving to 
the brokers, and the brokers command their servants to take the merchants and lodge them in one of the many 
houses kept for this purpose; the broker says to the merchant, “Go and take your rest, while I conduct your 
trade.” 

After Goa, Cochin is the most important base the Portuguese have in southwestern India. Much of the 
merchandise destined for the kingdom of Portugal originates there. Inland from Cochin is the 
pepper-producing region. But the pepper that goes to Portugal from Cochin is not as good as the pepper that 
goes to Arabia and Persia because the Portuguese had made a contract with the king of Cochin to buy the 
pepper at a very low price. Because of that, the Indian pepper growers bring their worst produce to the 
Portuguese and sell them pepper that is green and full of filth.
