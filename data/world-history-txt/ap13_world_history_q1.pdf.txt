documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in regard to

2013 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

Students were asked to analyze the connections between regional issues and European struggles for global 
power in the mid-18th century. The Seven Years’ War was clearly the global struggle that was meant to 
frame student answers, yet this was not stated in the historical background or explicitly stated in the 
documents. Students with deep knowledge of 18th century world, United States, or European history 
successfully understood the context of the question. The wording of the question led some students to 
group the documents geographically or to frame their responses as a purely European phenomenon. 
Although a map was given to help the students place the global areas identified in the documents, a 
historical description of the Seven Years’ War may have helped students better understand the context of 
the documents. 

Most of the source attributions gave students ample opportunity to assess point of view and to explain the 
need for an additional document. A lack of visual or quantitative sources provided students with an 
obvious choice for an additional document. 

The scoring guidelines asked students to make connections between regional issues and European 
struggles for global power only in the thesis, while all other score points could be earned by focusing on 
either regional issues or

 European struggles for global power. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 8 

The student presents a clear thesis in the introduction, focusing on the connection between European 
struggles for global power and the regional issues that they had to overcome to expand their power: native 
alliances, trade cooperation, diplomatic negotiation, and peace (1 point). The student addresses and 
understands all nine documents (1 point) and uses them all as evidence (2 points). Point of view is 
presented in documents 9, 2, 8, 7, and the 4/3 group (1 point). The student groups the documents in three 
ways: Economic Stability (documents 6 and 9), Native American Alliances (documents 2 and 7), and 
Austro-Prussian reliance on alliances (documents 3 and 4) (1 point). There are two successful attempts at 
an additional document, one from the perspective of a smuggler and the other from a merchant’s 
perspective (1 point). The essay was granted an additional point in the expanded core for point of view and 
the overall framing of the response with emphasis on connections (1 point). 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 5 

The student presents a weak thesis in the introduction with a stronger restatement in the conclusion, 
focusing on political and economic dominance that led to regional and global issues, specifically Saxony-
Prussia and colonial resistance (1 point). The student addresses and understands all nine documents (1 
point) and uses them all as evidence (2 points). Point of view is presented only in document 9, with a 
weaker attempt in document 3, so the response received no credit. The student groups the documents in 
four ways: Austro-Prussian struggle (documents 3 and 4), Colonial Alliances (documents 1 and 5), Failed 
Colonial Alliances (documents 2 and 8), and Colonial Trade (documents 6, 9, and 7) (1 point). There are two 
unsuccessful attempts at an additional document, one in the introduction and the other in the conclusion, 
that fail due to a lack of explanation.

Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2 

The student presents a weak thesis in the introduction with a stronger restatement in the conclusion, 
focusing on regional battles that escalated to global struggles for power (1 point). The student addresses 
only four documents (documents 7, 5, 3, and 4) and received no credit; the essay uses all of the addressed 
documents as evidence, but it needed to use at least seven to receive credit and therefore received no 
credit. Point of view is presented only in document 7, so the response received no credit. The student 
groups the documents in only two ways: French-British conflict in North America (documents 7 and 5) and 
Austro-Prussian War (documents 3 and 4) and received no credit. There is a successful attempt at an 
additional document on the last page (1 point).
