2007 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3—Comparative 

Overview 

The comparative question asked, “Within the period from 1450 to 1800, compare the processes (e.g., 
political, social, economic) of empire building in the Spanish Empire with the empire-building processes in 
ONE of the following: The Ottoman Empire OR The Russian Empire.” The heart of the question gets to the 
idea of empire building, not merely the existence of empire. As part of the core-scoring method, students 
were to develop an explicit thesis that compared and contrasted the process of empire building in Spain 
with either the Ottoman Empire or the Russian Empire. Second, students were to address similarities and 
differences in the development of the two empires chosen in their thesis. Third, evidence supporting 
empire-building in both empires was required. Fourth, students were to provide a direct comparison 
between the two empires related to the process of empire building. Finally, in the basic core, students 
were instructed to analyze a reason for a similarity or difference between the two empires. Students who 
fulfilled all of these core points were eligible for up to 2 expanded core points by providing a well-written 
essay that could include, but not necessarily be limited to, a strong thesis, numerous examples of 
evidence, and/or several direct comparisons.  

Sample: 3A 
Score: 8 

The thesis in the first paragraph focuses on the similarities between the Spanish Empire and the Ottoman 
Empire at a key point in the building of their empires in “[t]he Mid-Fifteenth Century” (1 point). The essay 
goes on to address the similarities in how the two empires expanded their territories by conquest and 
were devoted to religion, and the differences between the two in attitudes toward converts and in 
administrative structures (2 points). Accurate evidence about the process of empire building is abundant 
for both empires (2 points). Direct comparisons are ample, particularly in the last part of the essay 
(1 point). Analysis of the reason for a similarity is found in the discussion of religion and empire (“Because 
of their religious natures,”), receiving 1 point. The essay earned an expanded core point for sophistication 
of argument, giving it a final score of 8. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 4 

The thesis in the first paragraph (“Both Spain and Russia were working to make their empire[s] more 
successful yet [the] Spanish focused on exploration and things outside their land while Russia was like a 
nation starting over”) is minimally adequate (1 point). The essay addresses a similarity in the last sentence 
(“Both nations grow and expand their empire[s] during the time period”), earning 1 point, and adequate 
evidence about the process of empire building in Spain and in Russia is presented (2 points). There are no 
direct comparisons or any analysis, so the final score was 4. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 2 

The thesis attempt does not compare similarities and differences in the process of empire building in 
Russia and Spain, so the essay did not receive the thesis point. Further, the essay does not present 
similarities or differences in the process of empire building, so it did not receive the points for addressing 
all parts of the question. Sufficient evidence is used to support the process of empire building in each 
empire (2 points), but attempts at direct comparison are historically inaccurate and received no credit. The 
final score was 2.
