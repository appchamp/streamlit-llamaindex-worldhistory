Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence) 
(Historical skills and knowledge required to show competence.) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  

•  The thesis cannot be split and must be located in either the introductory  

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

paragraph or the conclusion.  
o 
o 

It may be a number of contiguous sentences. 
It cannot simply repeat the question.  

•  The thesis must address the social and economic effects of the global flow  

of silver as indicated in the documents. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.)  
•  There are eight documents. Students must address all documents in the essay  

and demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least seven documents.  

Listing the documents separately or listing the documents as part of a group does  
sufficiently demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one  

document. 
For 2 points: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from seven or eight documents and be connected  

2 Points 

to the thesis. 

For 1 point: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from six documents and must be connected  

to the thesis. 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 

1 Point 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 
o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this  
particular opinion OR what particular feature informs the author’s  
point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description of that individual by  

considering and explaining the tone, the characteristics of the author,  
the intended audience and/or how the intended outcome may have  
influenced the author’s opinion. 

Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating the  
information from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two or three ways,  

depending on the question. 
•  Students must explicitly group the documents in at least two ways. 

6.   Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate  
   additional document or source. 

•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document or source and  

explain how the document or source will contribute to an analysis of the effects 
of the silver trade.

2.  Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily 

2 points 

evenly or thoroughly. 
For 2 points: 
Essays must address: 
two countries 
• 
•  both similarity AND difference

related to goals and/or outcomes. 

4.  Makes at least one relevant, direct comparison between the two countries.  1 point 

•  The comparison/contrast between countries must be explicit and relevant  
to revolutionary goals or outcomes. [It is not sufficient to make statements

•  The direct comparison must be distinct from the thesis statement.

1 point 

in a direct comparison.

In regard to goals or outcomes, students must explain why a similarity or a  
difference occurs, or why a similarity or a difference is significant. [Analysis  
of goals or outcomes within one country is not sufficient for this point.] 

Note 1: For thesis, direct comparison, and comparative analysis points, the entire statement must be accurate.  
For evidence points, an inaccurate phrase can be ignored within an otherwise accurate sentence. 
Note 2: All categories but the thesis can double count. For example, a direct comparison might yield two or more 
evidence points.
