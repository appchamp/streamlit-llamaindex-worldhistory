“Describe and explain a significant continuity and a significant change in the global balance of political 
power in the period 1900 C.E. to the present.” (Historical thinking skill: Continuity and Change) 

Please note: 

•  Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis 

without earning the point for thesis. 

•  Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the 

student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the 
point for thesis. 

Scoring Criteria  
Thesis: Presents a thesis that 
makes a historically defensible 
claim and responds to all parts of 
the question. The thesis must 
consist of one or more sentences 
located in one place, either in the 
introduction or the conclusion.   
(1 point) 

Argument Development — 
Describes: Describes a historical 
continuity AND a change. 
(1 point) 

Notes 
•  Must address at least one continuity and at least 
one change in the global balance of power 1900-
present and have some explanatory element for 
each. 

•  Does NOT have to mention specific states but must 
be defensible with reference to political power 
across more than one region. 

•  Sample: Throughout the 20th century, the global 
balance of power continuously relied on alliances

Soviet Union. 

•  Must describe/identify at least one relevant 

example of continuity and one example of change in 
global balance of political power in the period 1900-
present.

Using Evidence — Examples: 
Addresses the topic of the 
question with specific examples 
of relevant evidence. (1 point) 

•  Must address the topic of the question by referring 
to at least TWO specific examples or pieces of 
relevant evidence reflecting global balance of 
political power. Essays can earn this point without 
having a stated thesis or a relevant argument.  

•  Samples: colonial empires, decolonization 

movements, alliances, fluctuations in state power 
tied to the world wars, Cold War interactions. 

Using Evidence — Effective 
Substantiation: 
Utilizes specific examples of 
evidence to fully and effectively 
substantiate the stated thesis or 
a relevant argument. (1 point) 

•  Must both present a significant amount of relevant 
evidence and clearly and consistently link that 
evidence to an argument about continuity or 
change in global balance of political power in the 
period 1900−present. 

Synthesis: Extends the 
argument by explaining the 
connection between the 
argument and either a 
development in a  

•  different historical 

period 

•  geographical area  
•  a course theme and/or 
approach that is not the 
focus of the essay or  
•  a different discipline. 

(1 point) 

• 

• 

• 

• 

(Period) may offer a relevant connection between 
the in-period continuity and/or change in global 
balance of political power and developments in 
other periods, e.g., during 1750−1900 C.E. or 1450–
1750 C.E.  
(Geography) not allowable because prompt is 
global.

in global balance of political power in this period to 
a course theme or approach that is NOT political 
history. Examples might include use of economic 
factors or cultural changes or environmental 
interactions.  
(Discipline) may connect the argument to a 
different discipline, such as sociology, economics, 
or demography, to extend a discussion of the 
continuity and/or change in global balance of 
political power in the period 1900−present.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Long Essay Question 3 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ knowledge of continuities and changes in the global 
balance of political power in the period from 1900 C.E. to the present. This content is part of Key Concepts 
6.2 and 6.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (Global Conflicts and Their Consequences and 
New Conceptualizations of Global Economy, Society, and Culture). The question covered a broad scope of 
course content and allowed students to demonstrate their knowledge of twentieth-century political history 
in relationship to the concept of global balance of power. To succeed in the question, students had to 
clearly identify both a continuity and a change. Successful answers had to address at least one continuity 
across most of the century (for example, reliance on alliances and coalitions, continued dominance of the 
West, continued disparities in economic and military power between developed and developing areas, 
etc.) and at least one significant change in the period (for example, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, the 
collapse of European colonial empires, the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, etc.) Some historical 
developments during the period, for instance, the role of the United States in the global balance of power, 
could be presented as either continuities or changes, depending on the direction of the student’s 
argument. Students had to present a historically defensible thesis, describe both a historical continuity 
and a historical change in the global balance of power during this period, explain the reasons for the 
historical continuity and the reasons for the historical change, address the topic with specific examples of 
relevant evidence, deploy the evidence to fully and effectively substantiate the thesis or a relevant 
argument, and extend the argument by either connecting it to a different course theme or another 
discipline or by comparing it to developments in other time periods. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 6 

The essay earned the thesis point for explaining the persistence of European power (continuity) in the 
context of imperialism and the rise of new powers because of the nuclear weapon (change). 

The essay earned the first argument development point by describing the continuity of the presence of 
European power in the world and the change of the advent of communism and nuclear weapons. 

The essay earned the second argument development point by explaining the continuity of European power 
in terms of long democratic traditions and continuing power through imperialism/neo-imperialism. It 
explains change through economic power and the possession of nuclear weapons. 

There are multiple pieces of evidence for both change and continuity in the essay that earned the first using 
evidence point for addressing the topic with specific examples of relevant evidence. 

The essay substantiates evidence well in the discussion of the Cold War at the bottom of page two and the 
top of page three, which earned the second using evidence point for effective substantiation. 

The essay earned the synthesis point for its explanation of art and philosophy in parallel with the political 
themes discussed in the essay. The synthesis is located in the last paragraph.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Long Essay Question 3 (continued) 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 4 

The essay attempts the thesis by describing the change and continuity, but it provides no explanatory 
element and did not earn the thesis point. 

The essay earned the first argument development point by describing a continuity (United States remained a 
major power) and a change (the rise and fall of Germany) as global political effects. 

The essay earned the second argument development point for explaining the role of military power and 
industry in the U.S.’s maintenance of global political power and for explaining the change in Germany’s 
global power through the defeat in the Second World War. 

The essay earned the first using evidence point for discussing multiple U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, 
Guam, and the Philippines and for victories in major twentieth-century wars. 

The essay earned the second using evidence point for effective substantiation by discussing U.S. global 
power around the world in terms of military bases and victories in war and suggesting that this military 
reach, along with industrialization, helped keep the United States in power globally. 

The synthesis attempts in the last paragraph were not successful. The attempt to connect the Roman Empire 
and the United States as major powers does not earn the synthesis point because the connection is not 
sufficiently explained. Many states possessed lots of power at various points in history. In addition, the 
attempt to connect the experiences of Germany in the twentieth century to early Chinese dynasties does not 
earn the synthesis point because the statements are too broad and do not sufficiently explain the connection. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 2 

The essay did not earn the thesis point because the attempted thesis in the first paragraph concerning 
military might does not directly support an argument related to the global balance of political power. 

The essay earned the first argument development point by describing the continuous importance of military 
might in maintaining a favorable balance of power and by addressing change through the development of 
nuclear capacity. The essay ties these military changes to the global balance of power. 

The essay does not contain a viable attempt at argument explanation tied to the global balance of political 
power, and so it did not earn the second argument development point. 

The essay earned the first using evidence point because it includes two specific pieces of evidence that 
provide examples of Cold War concepts (“mutually assured destruction”) and strategies (nuclear powers 
supporting groups with acceptable ideological stances) related to global balance of political power. 

The essay does not substantiate evidence and could not earn the using evidence effective substantiation 
point. 

The essay does not address synthesis and did not earn the synthesis point.
