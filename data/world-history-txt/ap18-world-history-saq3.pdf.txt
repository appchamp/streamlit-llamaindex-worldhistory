Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for explaining one difference in the way in which nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-

Eurasia before 1450 C.E. adapted to their environment 

•  ONE point for explaining one similarity between the economic practices of nomadic and sedentary 

societies in Afro-Eurasia in the period 600–1450 C.E. 

•  ONE point for explaining one major pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary 

societies in Afro-Eurasia before 1450 C.E. 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  Nomadic societies moved around frequently in search of new pasturelands, while sedentary societies 

did not. 

•  Sedentary societies mostly engaged in farming, while nomadic societies mostly engaged in 

pastoralism because that was more suitable to the steppes and deserts.

Short Answer Question 3 

•  Sedentary societies adapted their environment to support agriculture (building of irrigation systems 
and canals) and the need for protection (walled cities), while nomads were more likely to adapt their 
lifestyles to the natural environment. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  Both nomads and sedentary societies participated in and facilitated long-distance trade across Afro-

Eurasia. 

•  Rulers of both sedentary societies and nomadic societies (including nomadic rule over sedentary 

states) issued coinage to facilitate economic activity. 

•  Sedentary states and nomadic empires in Afro-Eurasia both used tribute collection to facilitate 

economic activity.  

•  Both sedentary states and nomadic empires levied taxes on their populations in order to increase their 

wealth. 

•  Nomads and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia engaged in both local and long-distance trade with 

each other because the nomads’ lack of economic specialization required that they acquire goods from 
sedentary states and because nomads frequently dominated the Silk Roads. 

•  Nomads and merchants from sedentary societies both facilitated long-distance trade in luxury goods 
across Eurasia, as nomadic elites sought to acquire luxury goods as markers of political status and 
sold their excesses to long-distance traders. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Missionaries and merchants from sedentary societies influenced nomadic peoples to adopt religions 

such as Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. 

•  One major pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia was 
technological exchange, such as when the Mongols facilitated the transfer of gunpowder from China. 
•  Sedentary societies often adopted the languages of nomadic peoples, as was evident with the spread of 

Arabic and Turkic languages. 

•  The sedentarization and Sinicization of some nomadic populations in China was one major pattern of 

cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia. 

•  One major pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia was 

exchanges in science and learning, such as when the Mongol rulers of China facilitated the 
transmission of Islamic science, mathematics, and geographical knowledge.

Short Answer Question 3 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to demonstrate an understanding of the difference 
between how nomadic peoples and sedentary peoples in Afro-Eurasia adapted to their respective environments 
in the period before 1450 C.E. Students also needed to explain a similarity in the economic practices of both 
nomadic societies and sedentary states in Afro–Eurasia in the period 600–1450 C.E. Finally, students were 
expected to demonstrate an understanding of patterns of cultural interaction between nomadic societies and 
sedentary societies in Afro–Eurasia before 1450 C.E. The question addressed Key Concepts 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 in 
the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of Comparison and 
Contextualization. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point because it explains that while nomadic peoples such as the Mongols and 

Bantus made little alterations to the land and instead migrated to find resources, the sedentary people of 
China altered their environments with the construction of the Grand Canal. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that both nomadic and sedentary states participated in and 

facilitated long-distance trade throughout Afro–Eurasia. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that religions such as Buddhism and Islam were spread 
from sedentary to nomadic societies. The response also notes that nomadic societies often helped further 
spread a religion, such as when Buddhism spread from India to the nomads of Central Asia, who then 
helped facilitate its spread in Han China. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because it explains how sedentary societies in Mesopotamia adapted to their 
environment by using the flood waters of rivers to support agricultural production, while the Mongols, a 
nomadic people, migrated throughout the steppes following their food sources. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that sedentary societies, such as the Byzantine Empire, and 

nomadic groups, such as the Mongols, used trade to acquire wealth and accumulate power. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it explains political interactions between nomadic states and 

sedentary states, not specific patterns of cultural interactions. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned 1 point because it explains that sedentary societies used land for agricultural 

production, while nomadic societies did not particularly “have to adapt to a single” environment” and often 
moved with their livestock, upon which they relied for food and clothing.

Short Answer Question 3 (continued) 

b) The response did not earn the point because it incorrectly identifies bartering as a primary economic 

practice for both nomadic and sedentary states during the period 600–1450 C.E. 

c) While the response identifies a common cultural belief among both nomads and sedentary societies, it did 

not earn the point because it does not explain a specific pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and 
sedentary societies.
