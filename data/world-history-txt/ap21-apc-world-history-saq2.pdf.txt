Question 2: Short Answer Primary Source 

3  points  

General Scoring Notes 

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE way in which the views reflected in the image represent a continuity with 
traditional notions of gender roles. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The image reflects patriarchal ideas of women. 
•  The image shows women as nurturers who fulfill domestic roles. 
•  The image portrays women as holding lower-status occupations. 
•  The image reinforces the importance of female beauty by placing the clothier at the 

top of the staircase. 

•  The poster reflects a male-dominated world view in which women were told that the 
most important parts of a woman’s life were to maintain her beauty, be “virtuous,” 
and perform domestic work. 

(B) 

Identify ONE way in which the views reflected in the image represent a change from 
traditional notions of gender roles. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The image shows new work and professional opportunities for women, such as being 

school teachers and factory workers. 

•  The image concentrates on women’s paid work, not their role as mothers and 

homemakers. 

•  The poster asserts that women play valuable economic roles in society. 
•  The descriptions in the poster show that the role of women in Western economies 

was changing and that women were taking on professions and work that had typically 
been reserved for men.

(C) 

Explain ONE way in which the format or intended audience of the source may have 
influenced the way in which gender roles are portrayed in the image. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The poster was aimed at individual women or women’s schools, so it was probably 

intended to reinforce existing ideas about women. 

•  Many people still could not read in the late nineteenth century, so it uses images as 

well as text. 

•  The image was aimed at a society in which agriculture was still important, so it 

applauds the work of peasant women. 

•  The image was produced in a Catholic society, so it mentions God and portrays 

religious women. 

•  The inclusion of the clothier and the worker in the image is due to the changing 

working environments and gender roles in industrializing societies. 

•  The placement of a woman merchant at the top of the image shows that women 
were gaining increasing economic independence in the nineteenth century.

Short Answer Question 2 

Overview 

Students were asked to evaluate an image of women in different social positions in France in the late 
nineteenth century to answer three questions. First, students were asked to identify one way in which the 
views reflected in the image represented a continuity with traditional notions of gender roles. Next, they were 
asked to identify one way in which the views reflected in the image represented a change from traditional 
gender roles. Lastly, they were asked to explain one way in which the format or intended audience of the 
source may have influenced the way in which gender roles were portrayed in the image. The question primarily 
addressed Topics 5.1., 5.9., and 9.5. of the AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying “the continued belief that women were obligated to the home.” 
The response would also have earned the point for the statement that “during this time, the ‘cult of 
domesticity’ gained immense popularity, arguing that women ought to take care of the family and home.” 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying that the “image reflects the increasing importance of women in 
the workplace following the Industrial Revolution.” 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining how the intended audience of “young women still in school” 
could be educated about new roles for women. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the continuity with traditional notions of gender roles through 
the continued “care of children and their husbands.” 

b) The response earned 1 point for the identification of the change with traditional notions of gender roles 
because it states that women were no longer “bound to the house” and were “working in factories.” 

c) The response did not earn a point because the statement that “it was avaliable to everyone” does not explain 
how the format or intended audience influenced the way gender roles are portrayed in the image. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying that women had more job opportunities but that they were 
unequal to those of men. 

b) The response did not earn a point because the statement that “women got new jobs because men also got 
new jobs (factories) due to industrialization” does not identify a way in which the views reflected in the image 
represent a change from traditional notions of gender roles.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued) 

c) The response did not earn a point because the reference to the jobs of the Industrial Revolution does not 
explain how the format or the intended audience of the image may have influenced the way in which gender 
roles are portrayed in the image.
