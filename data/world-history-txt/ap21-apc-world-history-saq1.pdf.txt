Question 1: Short Answer Secondary Source 

3  points  

General Scoring Notes 

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those 
errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the 
content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or why 

a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE non-Western nationalist leader whose actions might be used to illustrate the 
author’s argument in the passage. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Mohandas Gandhi is an example of a non-Western nationalist leader whose actions 

would support the author’s argument. 

•  Ho Chi Minh’s campaigns against the French in Vietnam illustrate von Laue’s 

argument. 

•  An example that supports the author’s argument is Kwame Nkrumah, who led Ghana’s 

independence movement. 

•  Mao Zedong was influenced by Western ideas of socialism and led revolutionary 

movements, thereby supporting the author’s argument about non-Western nationalist 
leaders. 

•  One example of a non-Western nationalist leader who would support von Laue’s 

argument is Gamal Abdel Nasser because he was heavily influenced by Western ideals 
but tried to reduce Western economic and political influence in Egypt. 

(B) 

Explain ONE way in which the “world revolution of Westernization” identified by von Laue 
in the passage disrupted non-Western societies. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Westernization led to imperialism and the destruction of traditional political and 

economic systems in many non-Western countries. 

•  The “world revolution of Westernization” disrupted non-Western societies because it 

led to colonial rule and poverty for many countries in Asia and Africa.

AP® World History: Modern 2021 Scoring Guidelines 

•  The “world revolution of Westernization” described by von Laue disrupted non-

• 

Western societies through imperialism, which brought Western industrial technology 
to large parts of the world. 
In much of the world, imperialism led many colonial societies to adopt Western ideas 
such as liberty and freedom and to fight for independence from European rule. 
•  Western countries exploited the rest of the world through imperialism, both directly 

and through economic control. 

(C) 

Explain ONE reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western 
imperialism in the way that von Laue does in the second and third paragraphs of the 
passage. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Decolonization was one reason why historians in the late twentieth century 

reinterpreted Western imperialism as something that “perpetuated inequality and 
ruinous cultural subversion” as von Laue claims. 

•  Decolonization encouraged many historians to reinterpret Western imperialism 

because many newly independent Asian and African states had serious economic and 
political problems that made many historians question the benefits of Western rule. 
•  As countries became independent from Western rule, historians from those countries 

could reassert the importance of their own histories and places in the world. 

•  The Cold War contributed to historians reinterpreting Western imperialism in the late 
twentieth century because the United States and the Soviet Union opposed continued 
European colonial rule. 

•  Globalization in the late twentieth century led many scholars to question assumptions 
about the superiority of Western society and values, especially as Asian countries 
caught up to the West economically without necessarily adopting Western cultural or 
political values.

Short Answer Question 1 

Overview 

For this question, students were expected to analyze a secondary source document by identifying a nationalist 
leader whose actions might be used to illustrate the author’s argument. Next, they were asked to explain one 
way the “world revolution of Westernization” disrupted non-Western societies. Lastly, the question prompted 
students to explain a reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western Imperialism. 
The question primarily addressed Topics 6.3, 7.1., and 8.1 of the AP World History: Modern Course and Exam 
Description. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying Nasser as a non-Western nationalist leader in support of the 
author’s argument. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how non-Western societies that came under Western control 
“caused them to want freedom,” which “increased violence.” 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining how historians came “to think about the matter 
differently”  because decolonization “increased the people’s sense of nationalism.” 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying Gandhi as a non-Western nationalist leader who illustrates von 
Laue’s argument. 

b) The response earned 1 point for explaining how Westernization disrupted Japanese society through the 
abolition of the samurai class. 

c) The response did not earn a point because the allusion to a “love-hate relationship” does not explain why 
historians would have reinterpreted Western imperialism. 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying Nelson Mandela as a non-Western nationalist leader who 
illustrates von Laue’s argument. 

b) The response did not earn a point because the statements about “inequality” and “new job positions for 
mainly men” do not explain how the world revolution of Westernization disrupted non-Western societies. 

c) The response did not earn a point because the references to the world wars and changes in “gender roles, or 
types of government” do not reflect von Laue’s reinterpretation of imperialism in the passage.
