Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence)   

1.   Has acceptable thesis.   

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must explicitly state at least one specific cause and at least two

specific consequences of the Green Revolution as evidenced in the documents.  

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified 

conclusion of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count as meaning, evidence, or grouping. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents. 

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
•  Students must address all 10
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least nine

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to specified causes and consequences of the Green Revolution. 
•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without 

context

 does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.   

2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of specific cause(s) or consequences of the 

Green Revolution must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence. 
      For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of specific cause(s) or consequences of the 

Green Revolution must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight
documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence. 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least one document.   

1 Point 

Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least one
•  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular 

 document. 

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining

 a document’s 

tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the 
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, 
but must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by 
providing some plausible analysis. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating 

information verbatim from the source line of the document.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in three ways. 

1 Point 

•  Students must explicitly and correctly group the documents in three ways
. 
•  A minimum of two documents (used appropriately) constitutes a group or 

subgroup. 

•  Students may not receive credit for both the larger group and the subgroups 

within it. 

•  Groupings must address with coherence the cause(s) and/or consequences of 

the Green Revolution. Examples of such groupings include: 
o  Causes (hunger/poverty, poor soil/depletion, U.S. policy on containment)

characterized, such as: 
•  Positive/negative results 
•  Economic impact (on productivity, population growth, wealth, women, 

companies that are beneficiaries)

•  Social changes (hardships for women, decreased rigidity of caste 
system, family structural changes, demands for better education, 
violence, population growth) 
o  Graphs depicting growth and development 
o  Occupations (government officials, scientists) 
o  Regions/countries (India/Punjab, Latin America, Guatemala, Mexico, 

United States) 

o  Organizations (United Nations, labor organizations) 

6.   Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional                 

document or source. 
•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document, source, or voice

causes or consequences of the Green Revolution.

2011 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

This question was intended to assess and analyze the causes and consequences of the Green Revolution 
from 1945 to the present. This document-based question (DBQ) challenged students with an event that 
they may not have known well. However, the documents provided them with rich evidence for the causes 
and consequences of the program aimed at preventing hunger. Additionally, the documents could be 
employed in a myriad of ways, giving students ample opportunity to develop many different and creative 
cause and consequence groupings. The content of the documents allowed them to group consequences 
simply as positive and negative; other possible groupings included environmental consequences, social 
consequences, and regional consequences. Attribution for the documents furthered students’ ability to 
group the documents, demonstrate point of view, anticipate the need for additional documents, and 
provide analysis.  

Sample: 1A 
Score: 8  

There is a thesis in the first paragraph that addresses causes and consequences (1 point). The response 
includes three groupings: Documents 1, 2, and 4 (“Before the Green Revolution”); Documents 5, 8, and 10 
(positive and negative consequences related to technologies); Documents 3, 6, 7, and 9 (“The Green 
Revolution caused many communities to gain”) (1 point). The essay addresses and understands all 
documents (1 point). Evidence is provided from all documents except Document 6, which is not 
specifically analyzed (2 points). Successful attempts at examining point of view are provided for 
Documents 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 (1 point). The first request for an additional document is found at the bottom of 
the second page, and the other is found in the final paragraph (1 point). The essay was awarded 1 
expanded core point for evaluating numerous points of view and a second additional document request.  

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6  

The thesis is found in the last sentence of the first paragraph (1 point). The response includes three 
groupings: Documents 5, 8, and 9 (grouped by region—consequences in Punjab); Documents 6 and 7 
(positive and negative consequences for women); Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4 (ending hunger as a 
consequence) (1 point). All documents are addressed and understood (1 point). Evidence is presented from 
nine of the 10 documents; the essay does not include analysis of Document 1 (2 points). Point of view is 
considered for Documents 5 and 8, as both authors are specifically addressed at the bottom of page 1 
through the top of page 2; point of view is also shown for Documents 3 and 4, which exemplify the 
importance of traditional viewpoints (1 point). A request for an additional document is attempted in the 
last paragraph, but no point was awarded because the explanation for why a document showing middle-
class beliefs would be helpful to the analysis is not adequate.

Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2   

There is no thesis in the essay. The response includes three groupings: Documents 1 and 2 (line graphs 
show an increase in food supply; also, Document 2 shows the relation between food supply and population 
growth); Documents 3 and 4 (causes); Documents 7, 8, and 10 (harmful effects) (1 point). The response 
addresses and understands all documents (1 point). No evidence points were awarded, as the response 
includes evidence for analysis from only seven documents (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10). References to other 
documents do not use them as evidence to support an analysis of causes or consequences. No evaluation 
of point of view is attempted. The additional document request appears at the end, but it is unacceptable 
because the request for “detailed information on … technology” brings nothing new to the interpretation 
(Document 8 addresses new technologies).
