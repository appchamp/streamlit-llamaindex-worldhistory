Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., different factors led to the emergence and spread of new religions and belief 
systems, such as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity. 

Develop an argument that evaluates how such factors led to the emergence or spread of one or more religions 
in this time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning (1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must make a 
claim that responds to the prompt, rather 
than merely restating or rephrasing the 
prompt. The thesis must consist of one or 
more sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically defensible 
claim about the way in which one or more factors led to the 
emergence and/or spread of one or more new religions or 
belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but 
it must identify a relevant development or developments in 
the period. 

Note: The thesis does not need to refer to a specific religion or 
belief system. The three religions listed in the introductory 
statement are provided as examples; it is not required that a 
successful thesis focus on one of these three religions. 

Examples: 

• 

• 

“Long-distance trade was the most significant factor 
in the spread of religions such as Buddhism and 
Christianity in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 
because trade facilitated greater and more enduring 
contact among cultural groups.” (Responds to the 
prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a 
line of reasoning) 
“Religions spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 
because they received state support.” (Responds to 
the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that 
establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the prompt  
(1 point) 

To earn this point the response must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the emergence and spread of new 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 
C.E. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.

Note: Contextualization attempts that refer to events after the 
period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. can earn the contextualization 
point only if the events are immediately adjacent to the 
period. 

Example: 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., large imperial 
states such as the Roman Empire and Han China 
dominated big parts of Afro-Eurasia and helped 
spread technology and religion.” (Relates broader 
events and developments to the topic) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the spread of 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 
C.E.

Note: For the three religions listed in the introductory 
statement, general assertions that they spread during the 
period should not be credited as “specific historical 
examples.” 

Example (acceptable): 

• 

“Emperor Constantine’s policies helped spread 
Christianity across the Roman Empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example (unacceptable): 

• 

“Christianity emerged and spread during the period 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.”(Does not count toward earning 
the point because there is no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory 
statement)

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points)  

To earn the second point the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., religions 
spread because of state support; religions spread because 
of trade), then the response can earn the second evidence 
point by using only one specific historical example for 
each part of the multipart argument (but the total number 
of examples used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  State support helping to spread religions, such as 

Christianity under the Roman Empire and Buddhism 
under the Mauryan Empire 

•  Merchants helping to spread religions in Eurasia, such 
as the Sogdians facilitating the spread of Buddhism in 
Central Asia and Christianity to China 

•  Compatibility between religious systems helping to 

spread religious practices, such as common principles 
of Greco-Roman and Egyptian polytheistic beliefs 
contributing to the spread of the cults of Osiris and Isis 
in the Mediterranean

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about how different factors led 
to the emergence or spread of religions in 
the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how 
different factors led to the emergence or spread of religions 
in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how state support led to the spread of a 

religion or a belief system  

•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or 

volumes influenced the spread of religions or belief 
systems 

•  Explaining how different or similar factors led to the 
spread of one or more religions or belief systems in 
different places 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of the 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt (2 points) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how different factors led 
to the emergence or spread of religions in 
the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument about the interaction of 
multiple factors in the spread of religious or cultural 
tradition in this period 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
political or economic factors led not only to the spread 
but sometimes also to the transformation of religious 
traditions through cultural syncretism 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how the same 
factors that led to the spread of religions or belief 
systems in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. also 
led to the spread of religions or belief systems before 
or after that time period

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the factors that led to the spread of religions or belief systems in the period 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: The thesis does not need to refer to a specific religion or belief system. The three religions listed in the 
introductory statement are provided as examples; it is not required that a successful thesis focus on one of these 
three religions. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“The expansion of empires and long-distance trade helped spread religions in the period 600 B.C.E. to 
600 C.E. because these processes facilitated contact between different peoples.” (Responds to the 
prompt with a claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“Long-distance trade was the most significant factor in the spread of religions such as Buddhism and 
Christianity in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because trade facilitated greater and more enduring 
contact among cultural groups.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line 
of reasoning) 
“Religions spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because they received state support.” (Responds to 
the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“New religions spread across Afro-Eurasia in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.” (Offers a historically 
defensible claim but includes no additional information beyond what is provided in the introductory 
statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism to China shows that military conquest was the most 
significant factor in spreading religion in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because rulers preferred to 
force others to accept their ideas.” (Not a historically defensible claim) 
“Afro-Eurasia was a melting pot of religious groups who shared ideas while trading.” (Potentially 
relevant to the prompt, but does not reference a specific factor leading to the spread of religions) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the emergence and spread of new 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Note: Contextualization attempts that refer to events after the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. can earn the 
contextualization point only if the events are immediately adjacent to the period. 

Example of acceptable contextualization: (hypothetical): 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., large imperial states such as the Roman Empire and Han China 
dominated big parts of Afro-Eurasia and helped spread technology and religion.” (Relates broader 
events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“Buddhism originated in India.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a reference and does not meet the 
requirement of “describe”) 
“Alexander’s conquests destroyed the Persian empire and briefly unified politically all of the eastern 
Mediterranean.” (Potentially relevant, but has no clear link to the spread of religions) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of how religions or belief 
systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. These examples of evidence must be different from the 
information used to earn the point for contextualization.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.  

For the three religions listed in the introductory statement, general assertions that they spread during the 
period should not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Emperor Constantine’s policies helped spread Christianity across the Roman Empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Christianity emerged and spread during the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.”(Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory 
statement) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how religions or belief systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Roman persecutions of Christian populations in the Mediterranean prior to 300 C.E. failed to stop the 
spread of the new religion. The emperor Constantine I recognized this fact and became convinced that 
legalizing Christianity would unify the empire and bolster his legitimacy as a ruler. So Constantine 
issued the Edict of Milan and held a great church council at Nicaea.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about how 
religions or belief systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. To earn this point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might 
be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining how state support led to the spread of a religion or a belief system  
•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or volumes influenced the spread of religions or belief 

systems 

•  Explaining how different or similar factors led to the spread of one or more religions or belief systems 

in different places 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the ways in which religions or belief 
systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an 
argument that addresses the question.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument about the interaction of 
multiple factors in the spread of religious or cultural tradition in this period 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that political or economic factors led not only to the 
spread but sometimes also to the transformation of religious traditions through cultural syncretism 
•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining how the 

same factors that led to the spread of religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. also 
led to the spread of religions or belief systems before or after that time period

Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

Overview 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the factors that contributed to 
the emergence or spread of one or more religious traditions in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. The question 
addressed Key Concepts 2.1 and 2.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework, focusing on both the 
formation and codification of religious traditions and on how religions spread via networks of communications 
and exchange. The question primarily tested students’ ability to deploy the historical reasoning skills of 
Causation and Contextualization and the disciplinary practice of Argument Development. Students were not, 
however, limited to using the skill of Causation, and successful responses demonstrated historical understanding 
by comparing religions or evaluating the changes in the spread of religions over the course of the time period. 
The question was open geographically to allow responses from multiple areas, with a specific chronological tie to 
the Classical era. Three religion/belief systems were presented in the prompt as examples (Buddhism, 
Confucianism and Christianity); however, students could address any religious system that arose or spread 
during the time period specified in the prompt. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it presents a clear thesis in the first paragraph of the essay. 
This thesis is well developed and identifies “trade and merchants, missionaries, and conquest and government” 
as factors that led to the expansion of Christianity, Buddhism, and Confucianism.  

The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it creates a strong context in which to situate the 
argument by giving detailed description of the time period. Inclusion of specific details such as the development 
of “Rome, the Mauryan empire and Qin and Han dynasties” indicates an understanding of the political 
developments of the time. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence because it provides specific evidence throughout the essay and 
connects it to several arguments. Details such as “Silk roads,” “silk, spices, porcelain, and olives” help to provide 
support for the argument being made that, in addition to these goods, religion also traveled along the trade 
routes. The second evidence point was also earned repeatedly throughout the essay, with explanations that as 
“as time went on, ideas and religion started being shared as well” connecting the roles of the Silk Road to 
Buddhism’s spread from India to China. Support for the argument is repeated in each paragraph, with numerous 
pieces of evidence used to develop each element of the argument.  

The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it clearly uses the skill of causation throughout the 
essay to develop each aspect of the argument. Each paragraph correlates to a specific factor identified in the 
prompt and is then developed as a reflection of the cause-and-effect relationship of that factor to multiple 
religions. 

The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it is thoroughly developed and 
presents multiple sides of each argument. It is notable that within each paragraph multiple religions are 
addressed as evidence of the point being made, demonstrating a high level of awareness of historical complexity 
by indicating how the factor being discussed was important to the spread of these religions. For example, in the 
second body paragraph, the response identifies “missionaries” as “responsible for the spread of religion around 
Afro-Eurasia.” This paragraph goes on to develop the argument using numerous specific examples from not only 
Christianity, but also Buddhism. Similarly, the next paragraph develops an argument about conquest spreading 
religion by using support that ranges from the conversion of Constantine to that of Emperor Ashoka. This ability 
to make connections between disparate regions of the world in the context of a well-developed and clearly

articulated argument that is fully supported with detailed specific evidence indicates a level of complexity more 
than sufficient to earn this point. 

Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it presents an adequate claim that “trade routes and 
missionaries” were factors that led to the emergence of religions.  

The response did not earn the point for contextualization because the attempt found in the first paragraph is too 
vague and also falls outside the acceptable time periods. The reference to “new modes of transportation” 
indicates an attempt to address the context of the spread of religion, but it does not clearly indicate modes of 
transportation, nor does it explain how these created a context in which religions would be likely to emerge. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence, beginning in the second body paragraph. The list of trade 
routes identified by the response (“Silk Roads, Trans Saharan, Mediterranean”) serves as three facts and earned 
the first evidence point. The continued discussion following this list indicates very nicely how these trade routes 
were factors in the spread of the religion. The response’s explanation that “As they travelled, they ‘brought’ their 
religion with them” opens the door to a clear explanation of the role the listed trade routes played in the 
expansion of religion, which earned the second evidence point. 

The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning because it is clearly centered on the use of the skill of 
causation. While this is evident in several places (such as the trade route paragraph discussed above), one 
indication is in the final body paragraph, where the explanation of how missionaries served as a factor in the 
expansion of religions demonstrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship. The response explains that 
missionaries’ expand their religion for the purpose of obtaining a “bigger following,” indicating that the effect of 
missionary action is the growth of the religion. Another example of historical reasoning (also causation) is 
present immediately before this, where the essay explains how the identified trade routes were used by 
merchants who “‘brought’ their religion with them” and were able to spread the religion by converting natives.  

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it fails to develop a 
complex argument. In the concluding paragraph, there is one attempt to go beyond the task of the prompt where 
the response introduces a vague mention of some areas that may never have been “uninfluenced” by trade routes 
and missionaries; however, this argument is not well developed.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because the opening paragraph presents a clear claim in response 
to the prompt. In this case, the thesis identifies the time period and then identifies “missionaries” and “goverment 
[sic] based religion” as causes of expansion for Christianity and Confucianism. The phrase, “But all that spreaded 
[sic] through trade,” continues the claim by identifying trade as a factor for expansion of all identified religions. 

The response did not earn a point for contextualization because the response does not attempt to create a context 
for its argument. 

The response earned 1 point for using evidence because it identifies a series of specific facts that can be used to 
support the argument, but it does not develop these facts into evidentiary arguments. Examples of accepted 
evidence include “silk road,” “med. sea trades,” and even the “holy lance.” These facts are presented merely as a 
list; however, and are not developed or tied into a base argument because the fact that religious items “became 
rare” is not an adequate explanation of how those facts led to the spread of religion. 

The response did not earn a point for historical reasoning because the response does not apply historical 
reasoning skills. 

The response did not earn a point for complexity because the response does not develop a complex line of 
argument.
