 2015 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

The question asked students to identify and analyze similarities and differences in any TWO of the 
following trade networks (Indian Ocean, Silk Roads, Trans-Sahara) in the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. 
Students were prompted that their response could include examples of biological, commercial, or cultural 
exchanges. In particular the question measured the historical thinking skill of comparison and 
contextualization (Skill 3). The question directly addresses Period 3 (600–1450). The question also directly 
addresses the fourth theme of the course (Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems) 
within a period when that theme is substantially related to many other historical developments of the 
period. The question most directly relates to Key Concepts 3.1 (Expansion and Intensification of 
Communication and Exchange Networks) and 3.2 (Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and their 
Interactions). 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 9 

The thesis paragraph at the top of page 1 identifies valid similarities between the Silk Roads and the 
Indian Ocean network (dominated by Muslim traders and relied on Chinese luxury goods) and a difference 
(Indian Ocean trade was never controlled by a single empire and was more open than the Silk Roads) (1 
point). The essay addresses a similarity in the second paragraph on page 1 and a difference in the first full 
paragraph on page 3 (2 points). The essay includes eight acceptable pieces of evidence throughout the 
essay, surpassing the required five pieces of evidence (2 points). It earned a point for a direct comparison 
on page 3 by focusing on Ibn Battuta’s documented influence of Islam on both trade routes (1 point) and for 
analysis of the same material (1 point). There is additional analysis at the top of page 3. Finally, the essay 
earned 2 points in the expanded core for making multiple comparisons, supported by detailed evidence, 
directly and thoroughly. The essay makes effective use of the extended illustrative examples of the travels 
of Ibn Battuta, as well as exhibiting a clear thesis that directs an effectively organized argument. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 5 

The essay has an attempt at a thesis, but goods, regions, and culture are too vague. The essay addresses a 
similarity at the bottom of the first page (both spread Islam) and a difference on the second page (people 
attempting to take control of the trade routes) (2 points). The essay identifies five pieces of evidence (2 
points): spread of Islam, Mongols, monsoon winds, Black Death, and influenza. The essay includes a direct 
comparison at the bottom of page 2: the Indian Ocean trade was active only when monsoon winds permitted, 
while the Silk Roads trade was year round (1 point). There is no acceptable analysis.   

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

This essay has no acceptable thesis. The essay addresses a similarity at the bottom of the first page (1 
point). The essay includes only two pieces of evidence. There is neither direct comparison nor analysis.
