Question 3—Comparative 

BASIC CORE (competence) 
(Historical skills and knowledge required to show competence.) 

      1.  Has acceptable thesis. 

0–7 points 

1 point 

•  The thesis cannot be split and must be located in either the introductory paragraph  

or the conclusion. It cannot simply repeat the question. 

•  The thesis must address BOTH countries, as well as BOTH a similarity and a difference,  

and must address either goals or outcomes. 

The thesis statement cannot be counted for credit in any other category. 

2.  Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily 

2 points 

evenly or thoroughly. 
For 2 points: 
Essays must address: 
two countries 
• 
•  both similarity AND difference 
•  at least one goal AND at least one outcome 
For 1 point: 
Essays must address: 
two countries  
• 
•  either similarity OR difference 
•  either one goal OR one outcome  

 3.  Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 

Essays must include at least one accurate piece of evidence for each country. 
For 2 points: 
•  Essays should include a minimum of FIVE accurate pieces of evidence  

related to goals and/or outcomes. 

2 points 

For 1 point: 
•  Essays should include a minimum of THREE accurate pieces of evidence  

related to goals and/or outcomes. 

4.  Makes at least one relevant, direct comparison between the two countries.  1 point 

•  The comparison/contrast between countries must be explicit and relevant  
to revolutionary goals or outcomes. [It is not sufficient to make statements  
that would be obvious from the question (e.g., “Both Mexico and Russia wanted  
political change in the 1910’s.”).] 

•  Mere parallel construction is not enough to earn this point. 
•  The direct comparison must be distinct from the thesis statement. 

5.  Analyzes at least one reason for a similarity or difference identified 

1 point 

in a direct comparison. 
• 

In regard to goals or outcomes, students must explain why a similarity or a  
difference occurs, or why a similarity or a difference is significant. [Analysis  
of goals or outcomes within one country is not sufficient for this point.] 

Note 1: For thesis, direct comparison, and comparative analysis points, the entire statement must be accurate.  
For evidence points, an inaccurate phrase can be ignored within an otherwise accurate sentence. 
Note 2: All categories but the thesis can double count. For example, a direct comparison might yield two or more 
evidence points.

Examples: 

0–2 points

o 
o  Outcomes and goals 

Interactions

2006 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3—Comparative 

Overview 

This question asked students to do six things: address revolution in two countries; explain similarities and 
differences (compare and contrast) between their revolutionary processes; and focus on the goals and 
outcomes of those revolutions. The question asked about goals and outcomes, rather than causes of 
revolution, and this emphasis ran throughout all the points on the scoring guidelines. 

The intent was to allow students to compare revolutionary process as regards goals and outcomes. This 
meant that students could write to their strengths by comparing selected points in each country’s history 
after the dates specified. They did not have to know the entire chronology to achieve a high score, 
although thorough chronological coverage was a reason to give expanded core points. 

To achieve any points for evidence, students needed to include specific and accurate historical evidence 
for both countries, although the pieces of evidence did not have to be explicitly comparative. Direct 
comparative statements, however, had to link both countries explicitly, rather than relying on the Reader 
to interpret parallel essay structure. Likewise, the comparative analysis had to link both countries in a 
statement (not necessarily a single sentence) explaining a difference or similarity in revolutionary goals or 
outcomes. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 9 

The thesis is found at the end of the essay, starting with “These revolutions are very similar . . .” (1 point). The 
attempt in the first paragraph does not count because it does not identify where a difference lies. The essay 
also fulfills all of the other basic core points: addressing all parts of the question (2 points); providing 
appropriate historical evidence for Russia and China (2 points); making at least one direct comparison  
(1 point); and analyzing a reason for a similarity or a difference (1 point). The essay earned expanded core 
points for richness of evidence, multiple direct comparisons, and sophisticated analysis (2 points). 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 6 

The thesis is in the first paragraph (1 point). The essay addresses all parts of the question in its discussion 
of similarity and difference between China and Russia and the goal and outcome in each country  
(2 points). It includes evidence for both countries related to the thesis (2 points) and makes a relevant, 
direct comparison (1 point). The essay lacks comparative analysis, however. It is strong on evidence but 
does not take the extra step to link that evidence to an analysis of difference or similarity between the two 
revolutions. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 3 

This essay lacks a thesis. While the response discusses a similarity (1 point), it does not discuss a 
difference. It contains just enough evidence related to revolutionary goals and outcomes to earn 1 point for 
evidence. The pieces of evidence for Russia are: “Russians began to question their government and 
demand civil liberties” and “The people wanted equality and since the Tsars weren’t going to give it to 
them they took it.” The claim that the people appointed Lenin is incorrect. The only relevant pieces of

evidence for China are that it became communist and the Chinese people “disgarded an oppresive [sic] 
way of life in hopes of equality.” The essay makes one direct, relevant comparison—the similar outcome of 
a communist regime in both countries (1 point). There is no comparative analysis of the similarity.
