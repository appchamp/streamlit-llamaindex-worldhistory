Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must include both Han and Roman attitudes toward technology with 

correct qualification of each empire. 

•  The thesis does NOT have to include a comparison of Han and Roman attitudes. 
•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay. 
•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs, or merely restates the prompt 

is unacceptable. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.)  
•  Students must address all eight documents in the essay. 
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least seven  

documents. 

•  Listing the documents separately or as a group does not adequately demonstrate 

an understanding of basic meaning. 

•  Merely quoting from the document does not demonstrate basic understanding. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from seven or eight documents and address the question. 
For 1 point: 
•  Evidence must be drawn from six documents and address the question.  

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 

1 Point 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents. 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular  

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description of that individual by considering  
and explaining the tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, 
and/or how the intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 
o  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document. 

5.   Analyzes documents by grouping them in two or three ways, 

depending on the question. 
•  Students must explicitly address the question by grouping the documents in  
at least two ways. Some examples include type(s) of technology, pro and con  
technology, role(s) of government with respect to technology, or by class,  
philosophers, government officials. 

•  Noting the Han documents (Documents 1–4) and/or the Roman documents  
(Documents 5–8) will NOT count as groupings, BUT noting Han or Roman  
officials or Han or Roman upper classes as groups is acceptable.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (continued) 

6.   Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional    

document or source. 
•  Students must identify an appropriate additional type of document or source  
and explain how the document or source will contribute to an analysis of Han  
and Roman attitudes toward technology. 
             Some potential additional types of documents: 

1 Point 

o  Documents by women—to explore whether there are similarities or differences  

in Han/Roman attitudes according to gender. 

o  Documents by workers—to explore the attitudes of those classes that might be  
most affected by various technologies or those classes that would physically  
implement a new technology. 

o  Documents with data about the effects of various technologies (road building,  

irrigation) to help explain positive/negative attitudes. 

o  Documents regarding the economic effects of technologies to help explain  

positive/negative attitudes.

2007 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1—Document-Based Question 

Overview 

As with previous document-based questions, students were required to answer the prompt using their 
analyses of a preselected set of documents. The prompt was straightforward and asked students to write 
an essay regarding Han and Roman attitudes toward technology based on their analyses of eight 
documents. The eight documents, four from Han China and four from Rome, were written by upper-class 
males and reflect little diversity in social opinion or class within their societies. In addition to showing the 
societies’ attitudes toward technology, students were to demonstrate their understanding of the 
documents by grouping them and analyzing the authors’ points of view. Finally, in order to provide 
evidence that they understood the broader context presented by the question, students were to identify an 
additional type of document and explain how it would help illustrate the attitudes of the Han and/or 
Romans toward technology. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 8 

The essay has a clear thesis in the introduction that correctly characterizes the attitudes toward technology 
for each empire (1 point). The student addresses all eight documents and demonstrates an understanding of 
each (1 point). Evidence of Han and Roman attitudes toward technology is drawn out of all eight documents, 
specifically addressing the question (2 points). The essay analyzes point of view in two documents (4 and 8), 
calling into question the validity of the documents because of the authors’ status or occupation (1 point). The 
student groups the documents in two ways: the Han view of technology as “self-glorifying” and “about 
helping the people” (Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4), and the Roman view as less positive, without concern for the 
common people (Documents 5, 6, 7, and 8) (1 point). Two additional types of documents are suggested in the 
second paragraph, with the student receiving 1 point for the discussion of the need for documents from 
women. The essay received all 7 basic core points, plus an additional point for including relevant information 
beyond the documents (the Han dynasty’s loss of the “Mandate of Heaven”) to analyze Document 4, for a final 
score of 8. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 5 

The thesis for this essay is in the conclusion that states the similarity in Han and Roman appreciation for 
new technology but notes their differences in areas in which the technology was used (1 point). The 
student addresses and understands the meaning of all eight documents (1 point). Support is drawn from 
Documents 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, but not from 1, 3, and 6, and thus the essay received no points for evidence. 
Point of view is analyzed in Document 2 (weakly) by discussing the document’s tone; in Document 4 by 
considering the government’s view of Tu Shih; and in Document 8 by discussing a general’s probable view 
of the Egyptians and Greeks (1 point). The student groups the documents in four ways: Han “appreciation” 
for technology (Documents 2 and 4); the Roman view of technology as “degrading” (Documents 5, 7, and 8); 
similar promotion of water technology (Documents 1 and 8); and similar appreciation for technology in 
general (Documents 3 and 6) (1 point). The student identifies two additional documents in the conclusion, 
receiving a point for noting the usefulness of adding a document with a woman’s perspective (1 point). 
The final score was 5.

Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 3 

The essay has a thesis in the introduction, but the student incorrectly interprets the Roman view (“Romans 
saw technology as unneeded”) and thus received no credit. The student correctly addresses and 
understands Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8, but misinterprets Documents 6 and 7, so received no points for 
understanding the documents. Support is drawn only from Document 3; therefore the essay received no 
points for evidence. Point of view is analyzed in Documents 8 and 4 (1 point). The essay presents four 
groupings: solving problems (Documents 1 and 8); “use of technology” (Documents 2 and 5); “productivity” 
(Documents 4 and 5); and views of philosophers on technology (Documents 3 and 7) (1 point). At the end 
of the second paragraph, the student identifies the need for an additional document from an official 
responding to Document 1 in order to assess the Han attitude toward technology more accurately  
(1 point). The final score was 3.
