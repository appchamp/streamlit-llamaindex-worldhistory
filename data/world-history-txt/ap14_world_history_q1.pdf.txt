2014 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

Students were asked to analyze the relationship between the Chinese peasants and the Chinese 
Communist Party during the period between 1925 and 1950. The documents lent themselves to an analysis 
that emphasized a deepening relationship over time. With access to several documents in both the pre-
1937 and the post-1949 periods, students were able to see the results of a long process of interaction 
between the peasantry and the Party. 

Most of the source attributions gave students ample opportunity to develop discussion of point of view and 
an additional document. The detail in the documents, as well as their use of evocative language, helped 
the students to use the documents more effectively in evidence and analysis.  

The scoring guidelines asked students to discuss relationships between the peasants and the Chinese 
Communist Party at most score points, which rewarded students for effectively answering the question.  

Sample: 1A  
Score: 9 

The student presents a clear thesis in the first paragraph, focusing on the relationship between the Chinese 
Communist Party and the peasants that emphasizes social equality, fostering “the state of the people,” and 
igniting nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment (1 point). The student addresses and understands all nine 
documents (1 point) and uses them all as evidence (2 points). Point of view is clearly presented for documents 
1, 2, and 6 (1 point). The documents are grouped in three ways: peasant nationalist unity sparked by Chinese 
Communist Party (documents 1, 2 and 3), Chinese Communist Party fostered anti-Japanese sentiment in 
peasants creating a popular cause (documents 4 and 5), and peasants gained social equality through Chinese 
Communist Party (documents 6, 7, 8, and 9) (1 point). There is one successful attempt at an additional type of 
document — asking for and explaining the voice of a peasant through a letter (1 point). The essay received 
an additional 2 points in the expanded core for historical context, strong additional analysis of documents, 
and in-depth analysis of point of view (2 points). 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6 

The student presents a thesis in the introductory paragraph, explaining how the Chinese Communist Party 
and peasants shared similar goals (1 point). The student addresses and understands all nine documents (1 
point) and uses them all as evidence (2 points). Point of view is only successful one time (document 4), and 
therefore the essay did not receive this point. The documents are grouped in three ways: the Chinese 
Communist Party and peasants become closer as peasants join the Party (documents 1, 2, and 3), the 
Chinese Communist Party rallies popular support during wartime (documents 4, 5, and 6), and the Chinese 
Communist Party brings social and economic equality to peasants (documents 7, 8, and 9) (1 point). There is 
one successful attempt at an additional type of document — asking for and explaining the voice of a 
supporter of Chiang Kai-shek (1 point).

 Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

The student presents a minimally acceptable thesis in the first paragraph, explaining that the Chinese 
Communist Party has improved peasant lives and that the relationship is “generally good” (1 point). The 
student addresses and understands four documents and uses only four documents as evidence 
(documents 2, 6, 7, and 8). There are no successful attempts at identifying an author’s point of view. Only 
one extended discussion of documents in a group explains the good things that the Chinese Communist 
Party has done for the peasants (document 2, 6, and 7). There is no attempt at requesting or explaining an 
additional type of document.
