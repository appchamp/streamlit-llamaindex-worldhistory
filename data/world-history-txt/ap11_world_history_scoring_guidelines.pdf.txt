Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence)   

1.   Has acceptable thesis.   

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must explicitly state at least one specific cause and at least two

specific consequences of the Green Revolution as evidenced in the documents.  

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified 

conclusion of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count as meaning, evidence, or grouping. 

2.   Understands the basic meaning of documents. 

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
•  Students must address all 10
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least nine

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to specified causes and consequences of the Green Revolution. 
•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without 

context

 does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.   

2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of specific cause(s) or consequences of the 

Green Revolution must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine

 documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence. 
      For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of specific cause(s) or consequences of the 

Green Revolution must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight
documents. 

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence. 

4.   Analyzes point of view in at least one document.   

1 Point 

Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least one
•  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular 

 document. 

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining

 a document’s 

tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the 
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, 
but must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by 
providing some plausible analysis. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating 

information verbatim from the source line of the document.

. 
•  A minimum of two documents (used appropriately) constitutes a group or 

subgroup. 

•  Students may not receive credit for both the larger group and the subgroups 

within it. 

•  Groupings must address with coherence the cause(s) and/or consequences of 

the Green Revolution. Examples of such groupings include:

characterized, such as: 
•  Positive/negative results 
•  Economic impact (on productivity, population growth, wealth, women, 

companies that are beneficiaries)  

•  Environmental problems (pollution, competition for water, altered seeds) 
•  Social changes (hardships for women, decreased rigidity of caste 
system, family structural changes, demands for better education, 
violence, population growth) 
o  Graphs depicting growth and development 
o  Occupations (government officials, scientists) 
o  Regions/countries (India/Punjab, Latin America, Guatemala, Mexico,

document or source.
