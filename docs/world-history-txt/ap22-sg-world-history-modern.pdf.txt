Question 1: Short Answer Secondary Source 

3 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE economic development that would support Biran’s argument in the passage 
regarding the Mongols and the “integration of the old world.”

Question 1: Document-Based Question, Imperialism and Asian and African economies 

7 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 
nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to 
advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Evaluate the extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Support an argument in response to the prompt by accurately 

content from at least three of the documents to address 
the topic of European imperialism and/or economies in 
Africa and/or Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries. 

Examples of describing the content of a document: 

Describe evidence from the documents relevant to the topic 
but do not use that evidence to support an argument

reversal in the trade between 1810 and 1830, with India 
exporting less cloth to Britain and importing much more 
cloth from Britain.” 

using the content of at least six documents. 

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a 
document: 
• 

(Document 5): “The account by the Congolese refugee shows 
how the Belgian colonizers’ harsh demands for rubber 
production led to starvation and violence among the native 
population. The account shows the extent of economic 
disruption brought to African society by imperialism.” 
(Connects the content of the document to an argument 
about the great extent to which European imperialism 
disrupted or even destroyed some African economies) 
(Document 6): “Ndansi Kumalo’s account shows the 
devastation of traditional African economies by imperialism, 
by relating how the Ndebele were forced into wage work for 
the White settlers in mines and farms, where they were 
subjected to high taxes.”  (Connects the content of the 
document to an argument about the extent to which 
imperialism transformed and disrupted traditional African 
economic activities) 

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  To earn 2 points, the response does not have to use the six documents in support of a single argument-they can be used across sub-arguments or to 

address counterarguments.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 
Responses that earn this point: 
•  Must use at least one specific piece of historical evidence relevant to an argument about the 

extent to which European imperialism affected economies in Africa and/or Asia in the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 

Examples of specific and relevant evidence beyond the documents that earn this point include 
the following if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  British investment projects, such as the building of railroads in India and Africa 
• 
•  Economic modernization initiatives taken by Asian and African states, such as the Meiji 

Large-scale European-driven infrastructure projects, such as the building of the Suez Canal 

Restoration in Japan 

•  The forced expulsion of ethnic groups from traditional land, such as during the Herero 

genocide or the displacement of Arab and Berber populations in French Algeria 

•  The use of military force to require Asian and African states to alter their trading patterns, such 

as during the Opium Wars 

Examples of evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument about the prompt: 
• 

“The British opium trade in China eventually led to the Opium wars, during which Britain used 
its military to force China to agree to unequal trade agreements.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument about the prompt) 
“Local elites often cooperated with European forces for their own benefit, even though those 
agreements did not necessarily benefit their subjects. For instance, Egypt cooperated with 
France and Britain to build the Suez Canal, but many Egyptian workers suffered and died during 
the construction.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in the documents relevant to an argument 
about the prompt) 

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
•  To earn this point, the evidence provided must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization. 
•  To earn this point, the evidence provided must be more than a phrase or reference.

without explaining the relevance of this to 
the point of view, purpose, historical 
situation, and/or audience 
• 

“In Document 2, the graphs show that 
Indian exports to Britain are declining 
while British exports to India are rising.” 

historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the 
three documents sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 
• 

(Document 1): “The author of Document 1 was a manager of a Dutch-government-owned sugar factory in 
Indonesia. As a manager, it would have been his duty to report to his superiors about the damage that the 
Dutch Cultivation System has inflicted on the availability of Indonesian labor for his factory.” (Connects the 
point of view of the author to an argument about the negative influence of Dutch imperial policies on the 
economy of Java)  

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 
• 

(Document 7): “The purpose of the account is to document the cruelty of the Germans and the economic 
hardships placed on Africans working on the cotton plantations. Because the account was given to African 
historians after Tanzania became independent, they would likely have wanted to emphasize the negative 
aspects of European imperialism.” (Connects a plausible speculation regarding the purpose of the source 
to an argument about the extent to which European imperialism affected African economies) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: 
• 

(Document 4): “The Ndebele ruler, whose territory was probably under a lot of pressure from White 
settlers as well as from neighboring African groups, likely thought that he had no choice but to trade away 
the right to mine raw materials in his country to the English in exchange for guns and a steamboat with 
which he could defend himself.” (Connects the historical situation of the document to an argument about 
an economic change in Africa brought about by European imperialism)

Complexity 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple 

causes, or explaining both causes and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. 
•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. 
•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following if appropriate elaboration is 
provided: 
•  Analyzing multiple variables, such as considering diverse or alternate perspectives or evidence. For 

example, a response may explore multiple economic impacts of European imperialism on native societies, 
including physical exploitation of native labor, collapse of traditional economic activity, restructuring and 
realignment of elites, changes to gender roles as a result of new economic demands, etc. (Explains 
nuance) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space. For example, a response may 

compare the effects of European imperialism seen in Documents 4 and 6 with the effects of imperialism in 
other colonial settings where large numbers of White settlers encroached on the territories of native 
peoples—such as in Australia or Algeria. Or a response may compare the exploitation of native labor for 
the extraction of resources, as seen in Documents 1, 5, and 7, with the exploitation of native labor 
through indirect imperialism in Latin America through forced labor systems such as indenture and debt 
servitude. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as explaining how European imperialism’s economic effects 
were complex and affected different segments of Asian and African societies in different ways. For 
example, a response might argue that, in addition to its destructive or disruptive economic effects, 
European imperialism in some cases benefitted parts of native societies through increased trade 
(Document 3), limited economic modernization (Document 1), strengthening of native elites 
(Document 4) or economic recovery after the initial disruption (Document 6). (Corroborates, qualifies or 
modifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

1. T.G. Edwards, 
manager of a Dutch 
sugar factory in Java, 
letter to the Dutch 
colonial government on 
labor shortages, 1858 

2. British East India 
Company, data reported 
to the British Parliament 
regarding the textile 
trade with India, 1810-
1830 

3. Bankim Chandra 
Chatterjee, The 
Cultivators of Bengal, 
article published in the 
Bengali press, 1872 

Reports on the negative effects of the 
imposition of the Dutch Cultivation System 
on the availability of Javanese labor for the 
sugar factory. Because of the demands of 
the Cultivation System, Javanese workers 
are subject to multiple labor demands, and 
the factory cannot get workers despite 
offering good wages. 

The graphs show divergent trends for 
Indian textile exports to Britain and British 
textile exports to India: Indian exports to 
Britain are declining while British exports to 
India are rising. The drop in Indian exports 
to Britain is particularly sharp for the calico 
and muslin cloth category, while the rise in 
British export to India is particularly great 
for the plain cotton cloth category. 
States that the growing trade between 
India and Britain has led to an expansion of 
Indian agriculture, as India has become an 
exporter of agricultural commodities to 
Britain. Acknowledges that the Indian 
cotton industry has collapsed because of 
cheap British cloth imports but suggests 
that the collapse can be managed by Indian 
weavers being more open to adopting 
other trades, such as cultivating rice. 

Explains the relevance of point of view (POV), purpose, situation, and/or 
audience by elaborating on examples such as: 

• 

• 

The author of Document 1 was a manager of a Dutch-government-owned 
sugar factory in Indonesia. As a manager, it would have been his duty to 
report to his superiors about the damage that the Dutch Cultivation System 
had inflicted on the availability of Indonesian labor for his factory. (POV, 
purpose) 
The Cultivation System was an attempt by the Dutch colonial authorities in 
the East Indies to force the native population to produce cash crops for the 
Dutch. This reflected a general push to make colonies more profitable for 
Europe by extracting raw materials or commodities for export. (situation) 
•  As Great Britain was becoming an increasingly industrialized country during 
this period, the purpose of the EIC providing this data to Parliament may 
have been in part to show that it was playing its part in providing markets 
for British industrial goods, the most important one of which was cotton 
textiles. (purpose) 

• 

•  Because of the system of Company Rule in India, the EIC, rather than the 
British government, had effective control of large parts of the Indian 
subcontinent. That explains why it was the EIC’s responsibility to collect such 
trade information and report it to the British Parliament. (situation) 
The publication of this perspective on the economic impact of India’s trade 
with Great Britain in an Indian (Bengali) newspaper was likely meant in part 
to challenge the Indian audience’s notions of rigid caste distinctions. By 
emphasizing that the ‘reluctance to give up hereditary trades’ has become 
an economic liability, the author is urging Indians to loosen the rigid 
restrictions in their society in order to make India more adaptable to 
economic change. (audience, purpose) 
The article suggests that Chatterjee shared the position of many educated 
Indian intellectuals at the time that India could benefit socially and 
economically from British rule. He emphasizes the economic benefits of 
trade with Britain and the opportunities trade may bring for modernizing 
Indian society. (POV, situation)

4. King Lobengula 
Khumalo, Contract with 
an English company over 
mining rights in Ndebele 
territory, 1888 

The ruler of the Ndebele enters into a 
contract with three British business 
associates of Cecil Rhodes’ mining 
company, awarding them exclusive mining 
rights in his territories, in exchange for a 
monthly payment, English rifles, and a 
promise to deliver a steamboat with guns 
on the Zambezi River. 

5. Moyo, Congolese 
refugee, testimony for a 
Belgian investigation 
into abuses related to 
rubber collection in the 
Congo, 1904 

6. Ndansi Kumalo, 
account of living 
conditions of the 
Ndebele in the 1890s, 
given to a British 
anticolonial activist, 
published in 1936 

•  Describes the hardships on the native 
population produced by the Belgian 
authorities’ cruel system of extracting 
rubber by imposing rubber production 
quotas on Congolese villages. The villagers 
found it harder and harder to meet the 
quota, needing to go further and further 
into the jungle to find rubber trees. As 
more members of village society, including 
women, had to work to make the rubber 
quota, cultivation of food crops was 
abandoned, and starvation set in. The 
authorities did not reduce the quota and 
only provided token payments for the 
rubber. 

•  Outlines the shifts in Ndebele economic 

activities after the end of the unsuccessful 
Ndebele revolt in 1897; the Ndebele had 
lost their cattle (traditional source of 
wealth) during the revolt and were forced 
into paid work for the White settlers, in 
mines and in agriculture. In addition to 
that, the Ndebele were subjected to heavy 
taxes by the British colonial government, 
including a rent tax for allegedly living on 
White settlers’ land. 

• 

The Ndebele ruler, whose territory was probably under a lot of pressure 
from White settlers as well as from neighboring African groups, likely 
thought that he had no choice but to trade away the right to mine raw 
materials in his country to the English in exchange for guns and a steamboat 
with which he could defend himself. (POV, situation) 

• 

•  By emphasizing that “various [other] persons and companies” have sought 
the rights to mine in his territories, King Lobengula may have wanted to 
convey to Cecil Rhodes’ company that his company must abide by its 
obligations under the contract. (purpose, audience) 
The Belgian authorities’ system of rubber extraction from the Congo reflects 
both the prevalent racial views in late-nineteenth-century Europe that saw 
Africans as racially inferior, and thus they were subjected to inhumane 
working conditions. Europeans also recognized the economic importance of 
strategic natural resources such as rubber to Europe’s industrializing 
economies. (situation) 

•  As an eyewitness account of a refugee from the atrocities it describes, 
Moyo’s account is likely credible in its description of the devastating 
economic and social toll of the Belgian rubber quota systems on Congolese 
villages. (POV) 

•  As an oral history narrative recorded decades after the events it describes, 
Ndansi Kumalo’s account represents a long-term assessment of the social 
and economic effects of the Ndebele revolt on the Ndebele people. As such 
it focuses on big changes, such as, the transition from subsistence cattle 
raising to wage work, especially in mining, and the transition to being 
integrated into the White-settler dominated economy of South Africa 
through the paying of taxes and using money. (audience, POV) 
The context of the economic and social changes described in the document 
is the growing rate of White settlement in interior parts of southern Africa 
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, encroaching on the 
lands of native peoples such as the Ndebele. The discovery of gold, 
diamonds, and other resources in various parts of the region exacerbated 
this process. (situation)

7. Anonymous 
Tanzanian participant in 
Maji Maji uprising, 
account of conditions on 
German cotton 
plantations during the 
1900s, published in 
1967 

•  Describes the labor obligations imposed on 
Africans by the German colonizers’ creation 
of cotton plantations in the first decade of 
the twentieth century. African villagers 
were required to work on the cotton 
plantations on allotted days of the week. 
Work conditions on the plantations were 
brutal, and Africans were also subjected to 
paying taxes in addition to their forced 
labor obligations. This led to Africans 
hating German rule. 

• 

The purpose of the account is to document the cruelty of the Germans and 
the economic hardships placed on Africans working on the cotton 
plantations. Because the account was given to African historians after 
Tanzania became independent, they would likely have wanted to emphasize 
the negative aspects of European imperialism. (purpose, audience) 
•  As a relative latecomer to European imperialism in Africa, Germany was 
eager to show that it could bring “progress” to its African colonies, which 
often meant starting economic activities in the colonies that would be 
profitable to the German colonialists. The cotton plantations in Tanzania 
(Tanganyika) were an example of such enterprises, where resource 
extraction was accomplished at the cost of harsh economic exploitation of 
the African workers. (situation)

Question 2: Long Essay Question, Pre-Columbian States 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the period before circa 1500, states in the Americas used a variety of institutions, policies, and practices to consolidate and expand their scope and 
reach. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which ONE pre-Columbian state in the Americas was successful in consolidating and centralizing its 
authority during this period.

•  Olmec and Toltec states 
•  Mexica religious practices 
•  Writing systems and recordkeeping in the Americas 
Example of a statement that earns 1 point for evidence: 
• 

“Maya city-states used religious rituals and profited from 
long distance trade.” 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 
support an argument regarding how ONE pre-
Columbian state in the Americas was successful in 
consolidating and centralizing its authority. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence: 
• 

“The Mexica developed centralized religious and 
tributary systems to exert control over their clients, 
allies, and conquered peoples. Their monuments, 
human sacrifices, and bureaucracies helped them 
rule an expansive empire.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence to support the argument 
regarding how one pre-Columbian state in the 
Americas was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing its authority) 
“One way the Inca were able to rule over such a 
vast empire was through the use of roads such as 
the Carpa Nan which spanned the entirety of the 
Inca Empire and allowed for efficient transport, 
trade, and communication.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence to support the argument 
regarding how one pre-Columbian state in the 
Americas was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing its authority) 

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, discussion of the development of the Aztec tribute system; the development of the Inca management of their road system)

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an  Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining how the expansion of empires such as 
the Aztecs resulted in conflict between competing 
kingdoms and ethnic groups. 

following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by showing that the Mayan city 

states were prevented from consolidating a large empire through a 
combination of environmental challenges such as major droughts as 
well as competition from neighboring states. (Explains nuance, 
considers both causes and effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining how the decentralization of Mayan city-
states limited the ability of rulers to consolidate 
their administrations. 

•  Explaining increased centralization led to the 

creation of large monuments and the collection of 
precious metals and jewelry. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 

“Aztec rulers used warfare and tribute collection to 
amass wealth that allowed them to build 
monuments to show their authority.” (Establishes a 
development that contributed to the centralization 
of pre-Colombian states in the relevant period. This 
statement would need to be followed up with at 
least minimal discussion of the development 
introduced.) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 

such as demonstrating how the Incan and Aztec empire both 
expanded their states through a combination of conquest and political 
alliances, such as the alliance between major Aztec cities. (Explains 
relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that while the mound 
building culture of the Mississippi River Valley built numerous 
monuments, there is limited evidence demonstrating centralized 
administration. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by demonstrating how the Iroquois 

confederation’s formation and expansion was a direct response to 
European colonial expansion into Canada and the Ohio River Valley. 
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 3: Long Essay Question, Conflict and Religious Change 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the period circa 1450–1750, the global increase in transregional contacts led to both expansion and contraction of existing religions as well as the 
development of new religious practices. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which military conflict or conquest was the main cause of religious change in this period.

relevant to the topic of the prompt. 
•  Provide evidence that is outside the 
time period or region specified in 
the prompt. 

•  Repeat information that is specified 

in the prompt. 

Examples that do not earn points: 
• 
“Joseph Stalin sent many of his 
political opponents to gulags.” 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
• 

Identify at least two specific historical examples relevant 
to free-market ideas or economic change in the late 
twentieth century. 

Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include 
the following (two examples required): 
•  Mikhail Gorbachev 
•  Glasnost and perestroika 
•  Ronald Reagan 
•  Margaret Thatcher 
•  Berlin Wall falling 
•  Deng Xiaoping 
•  Neocolonialism 
•  World Bank or IMF 
•  Specific developing states that adopted liberal economies 

in Latin America or Asia 

•  Expansion of specific multinational corporations 
•  Creation of international trade organizations like NAFTA 

or ASEAN 

•  Economic development or underdevelopment of specific 

states or regions 

Example of a statement that earns 1 point for evidence: 
• 
“Margaret Thatcher weakened the labor unions and 
privatized several industries in Great Britain.” 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 

support an argument regarding how the spread of 
free-market ideas led to economic change in the 
late twentieth century. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence: 
• 

“China and India liberalized their economies and 
adopted mixed socialist-capitalist economies in 
order to increase foreign investment and economic 
growth.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence 
to support the argument regarding how the spread 
of free-market ideas led to economic change in the 
late twentieth century) 
“International economic institutions like the IMF 
and World Bank required states to adopt free-
market policies in order to get loans or forgive 
debts.” (Uses evidence to support the argument 
regarding how the spread of free-market ideas led 
to economic change in the late twentieth century) 

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, the development of international institutions promoting free trade like the IMF; the development of individual nations transitioning into a free-
market economic system like Russia)

economic change in the late twentieth century 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an  Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the way in which the end of the Cold 
War led to the spread of free-market ideas. 
•  Explaining how the development of multinational 
corporations expanded in developing nations. 
•  Explaining how the development of free-market 
trade affected regional or national economies. 
Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 

following if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by considering how outsourcing and 
the expansion of multinational corporations often helped to raise 
living standards in developing countries while also leading to job 
displacement in developed economies. (Explains nuance, considers 
both causes and effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 

“As the Cold War came to an end, China and Russia 
restructured their centrally planned economies 
during the 1980s and 1990s in order to participate 
more broadly in the global capitalist economic 
system.” (Establishes a development that 
contributed to the growth of free-market trade in 
the relevant period. This statement would need to 
be followed up with at least minimal discussion of 
the development introduced.) 

such as explaining the ways in which the end of the Cold War 
contributed to the perceived triumph of liberal capitalist markets and 
the ways in which this often brought changes to former communist 
countries’ economies. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 
•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that although free-market 
economics spread in many parts of the world, criticisms of free-
market economics, often influenced by communist or Marxist 
traditions, endured. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by describing how several Pacific Rim 
states in Asia, such as South Korea and Taiwan, liberalized their 
economies in order to increase their exports and promote growth. 
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.
