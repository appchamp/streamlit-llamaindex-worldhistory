Question 1: Short Answer Secondary Source 

3 points 

General Scoring Notes 

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those 
errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the 
content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or why 

a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE non-Western nationalist leader whose actions might be used to illustrate the 
author’s argument in the passage. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Mohandas Gandhi is an example of a non-Western nationalist leader whose actions 

would support the author’s argument. 

•  Ho Chi Minh’s campaigns against the French in Vietnam illustrate von Laue’s 

argument. 

•  An example that supports the author’s argument is Kwame Nkrumah, who led Ghana’s 

independence movement. 

•  Mao Zedong was influenced by Western ideas of socialism and led revolutionary 

movements, thereby supporting the author’s argument about non-Western nationalist 
leaders. 

•  One example of a non-Western nationalist leader who would support von Laue’s 

argument is Gamal Abdel Nasser because he was heavily influenced by Western ideals 
but tried to reduce Western economic and political influence in Egypt. 

(B) 

Explain ONE way in which the “world revolution of Westernization” identified by von Laue 
in the passage disrupted non-Western societies. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Westernization led to imperialism and the destruction of traditional political and 

economic systems in many non-Western countries. 

•  The “world revolution of Westernization” disrupted non-Western societies because it 

led to colonial rule and poverty for many countries in Asia and Africa.

AP® World History: Modern 2021 Scoring Guidelines 

•  The “world revolution of Westernization” described by von Laue disrupted non-

• 

Western societies through imperialism, which brought Western industrial technology 
to large parts of the world. 
In much of the world, imperialism led many colonial societies to adopt Western ideas 
such as liberty and freedom and to fight for independence from European rule. 
•  Western countries exploited the rest of the world through imperialism, both directly 

and through economic control. 

(C) 

Explain ONE reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western 
imperialism in the way that von Laue does in the second and third paragraphs of the 
passage. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  Decolonization was one reason why historians in the late twentieth century 

reinterpreted Western imperialism as something that “perpetuated inequality and 
ruinous cultural subversion” as von Laue claims. 

•  Decolonization encouraged many historians to reinterpret Western imperialism 

because many newly independent Asian and African states had serious economic and 
political problems that made many historians question the benefits of Western rule. 
•  As countries became independent from Western rule, historians from those countries 

could reassert the importance of their own histories and places in the world. 

•  The Cold War contributed to historians reinterpreting Western imperialism in the late 
twentieth century because the United States and the Soviet Union opposed continued 
European colonial rule. 

•  Globalization in the late twentieth century led many scholars to question assumptions 
about the superiority of Western society and values, especially as Asian countries 
caught up to the West economically without necessarily adopting Western cultural or 
political values.

3 points 

General Scoring Notes 

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE way in which the views reflected in the image represent a continuity with 
traditional notions of gender roles. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The image reflects patriarchal ideas of women. 
•  The image shows women as nurturers who fulfill domestic roles. 
•  The image portrays women as holding lower-status occupations. 
•  The image reinforces the importance of female beauty by placing the clothier at the 

top of the staircase. 

•  The poster reflects a male-dominated world view in which women were told that the 
most important parts of a woman’s life were to maintain her beauty, be “virtuous,” 
and perform domestic work. 

(B) 

Identify ONE way in which the views reflected in the image represent a change from 
traditional notions of gender roles. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The image shows new work and professional opportunities for women, such as being 

school teachers and factory workers. 

•  The image concentrates on women’s paid work, not their role as mothers and 

homemakers. 

•  The poster asserts that women play valuable economic roles in society. 
•  The descriptions in the poster show that the role of women in Western economies 

was changing and that women were taking on professions and work that had typically 
been reserved for men.

AP® World History: Modern 2021 Scoring Guidelines 

(C) 

Explain ONE way in which the format or intended audience of the source may have 
influenced the way in which gender roles are portrayed in the image. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The poster was aimed at individual women or women’s schools, so it was probably 

intended to reinforce existing ideas about women. 

•  Many people still could not read in the late nineteenth century, so it uses images as 

well as text. 

•  The image was aimed at a society in which agriculture was still important, so it 

applauds the work of peasant women. 

•  The image was produced in a Catholic society, so it mentions God and portrays 

religious women. 

•  The inclusion of the clothier and the worker in the image is due to the changing 

working environments and gender roles in industrializing societies. 

•  The placement of a woman merchant at the top of the image shows that women 
were gaining increasing economic independence in the nineteenth century.

Explain ONE way in which political continuities in China influenced the development of the 
global economy in the period 1200–1750. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  The relative stability of Chinese governments helped make China a major producer of 

luxury goods for export to Afro-Eurasia. 

•  Chinese imperial policies encouraged the import of silver, first from Japan and then 

from the Americas. 

•  China’s stability and productivity encouraged the growth of trade routes such as the

•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE continuity in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 
1750–1900. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  A continuity in South and Southeast Asian politics was that many indigenous rulers 

continued to rule. 

•  One continuity in the politics of South and Southeast Asia was that Europeans 

continued to challenge the power of local rulers. 

•  One way in which there was continuity in South Asia was that the Mughal emperor 

remained the figurehead ruler of India until the British deposed him. 

•  Many rulers in India and Southeast Asia continued to rule by allying themselves with 

European powers. 

•  Through the middle of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company rather 

than the British government ruled many areas of India. 

(B) 

Identify ONE change in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 
1750–1900. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  One change in India was that the Mughal Empire collapsed. 
•  A significant change in the political order in Southeast Asia during this period was the 

arrival of the French, who proceeded to colonize Indochina. 

•  One major change during this period was that the British crown assumed direct rule 

over India following the Indian Rebellion in 1857. 

•  One change was that the Marathas established an empire in India.

AP® World History: Modern 2021 Scoring Guidelines 

•  One change was that European East India companies (British, Dutch, French, etc.) 

expanded their political power and transitioned into developing colonial governments. 

(C) 

Explain ONE way in which changes in the global economy led to changes in the political 
systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 1750–1900. 

1 point 

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  One reason that the political systems of South and Southeast Asia changed was the 

• 

expansion and evolution of European empires. 
Industrialization in Europe fundamentally changed the political systems of South and 
Southeast Asia in this period because industrialization allowed Europeans to conquer 
and administer much of the region through superior weapons and ships. 

•  Because of deeper global economic integration and the establishment of European 
rule, many political elites in South Asia and Southeast Asia continued to hold their 
traditional political titles but lost all real political power and instead became wealthy 
landowners whose estates often produced raw materials for industrial factories in 
Europe. 

•  European states reacted to the development of the global capitalist economy by 
attempting to extract resources and open up markets by force and to create 
monopolies over trade with certain areas, which required gaining direct or indirect 
political control.

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature 

of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the 
argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Evaluate the extent to which economic factors led to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920).

Responses that do not earn this point: 
•  Are not historically defensible. 
•  Only restate or rephrase the prompt. 
•  Do not respond to the prompt. 
•  Do not establish a line of reasoning. 
•  Are overgeneralized. 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
•  Provide a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a position on the 
extent to which economic factors led to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution 
(1910–1920). The thesis or claim must either provide some indication of the reason 
for making that claim OR establish categories of the argument. 

Examples that do not earn this point: 
Provide a historically defensible claim, but do not establish a line of 
reasoning 
• 

“Economic factors were critical in leading to the outbreak of the 
Mexican Revolution.” 

Establish a line of reasoning, but do not provide a historically 
defensible claim 
• 

“Economic exploitation in Mexico led to the revolution because most 
of the Mexican people were enslaved on plantations.” 

Do not focus on the topic of the prompt 
•  “The Mexican Revolution is important to understand because it is 

the southern neighbor of the United States.” 

Examples that earn this point: 
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt 
• 

“Mexico’s inability to resist the political dominance of the United States and 
European powers was the most significant factor in leading to the revolution 
because foreign dominance prevented the Mexican government from enacting 
economic reforms.” 

• 

“Ethnic tensions were just as important in leading to the Mexican Revolution as 
economic factors because much of the economic exploitation that was occurring in 
Mexico affected poor indigenous communities.” 

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic 
categories 
• 

“Although noneconomic factors such as government corruption and ethnic tensions 
contributed to the Mexican Revolution, economic factors such as labor exploitation 
and economic inequality were the most important factors in sparking the 
revolution.” 

Establish a line of reasoning 
• 

“The government’s policies led to the Mexican Revolution because the government 
refused to help workers.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim) 

Additional Notes: 
•  The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the 

first or last paragraphs). 

•  The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 
• 

(Document 1): “The finance minister tells strikers that 
unemployment is the result of supply and demand and is out of the 
government’s hands, a position which probably increased people’s 
discontent with the government because they were unwilling to 
help.” (Connects the contents of the document to an argument 
about the extent to which economic factors contributed to the 
outbreak of the Mexican Revolution) 
(Document 2): “The newspaper cartoon shows that the government 
was willing to use violence to put down popular protests against a 
rigged election system. Such oppressive government policies may 
have contributed to increased support for the eventual revolution.”

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
•  Must explain how or why—rather than simply identifying—the document’s point of view, purpose, historical 
situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the three documents 
sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 
• 

(Document 3): “As a diplomatic representative of the Diaz government, Godoy is focused only on the positive 
aspects of United States investment in Mexico and lavishes praise on Diaz.” (Identifies the point of view of the 
source and how this might be relevant to the extent to which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of 
the Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 
• 

(Document 7): “The corrido is meant to memorialize a hero of the revolution and to motivate the people to carry 
on his struggle, and to ‘punish the rich’ and make ‘Indians owners of their lands,’ both of which were major 
economic goals of the revolutionaries.” (Connects the purpose of the song to an argument about the extent to 
which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source: 
• 

(Document 6): “Ricardo Magón uses the history of Native Americans, especially the taking of their land and their 
oppression by white colonizers to argue for a revolution that would take back the land and give it to the workers, 
pointing out the fundamental corruption that allowed Spanish elites to acquire the land that the native 
Americans now work.” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical situation of the document and connects that 
information to an argument about the extent to which economic factors contributed to the outbreak of the 
Mexican Revolution) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: 
• 

(Document 3): “In his speech, Consul Godoy is being deferential to the Chamber of Commerce because he is 
conscious of their influence in channeling United States investment to Mexico.” (Provides information about the 
audience of the government official that is relevant to an argument about the extent to which economic factors 
contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution)

Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using 
evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question. 

Complexity 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple 

causes, or explaining both causes and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods. 
•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes. 
•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Analyzing multiple variables, such as considering diverse or alternate perspectives or evidence, such as how, for 
instance, a response arguing that economic exploitation in Mexico often coincided with the oppression of ethnic 
minorities could use Documents 6 and 7 to show how some revolutionaries specifically appealed to Native 
histories of dispossession and complement this analysis with the description of the enslavement of Yaqui 
Indians in Document 4 in service of plantations producing materials for European and U.S. industry. (Explains 
nuance) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining similarities and 

differences between the motivating factors of the Mexican Revolution and other revolutions in the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries. For instance, a response could draw explicit and insightful comparisons by bringing in 
outside information on the situation in Russia prior to the Bolshevik Revolution and then using the documents 
describing the situation of the peasants and workers in Mexico to show how economic problems fueled 
revolutionary movements in both countries. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as explaining how different documents corroborate an argument in 
spite of the differing perspectives of the authors. For instance, a response could use the praise of Diaz in 
Document 3, which celebrates the business relationship between the U.S. and Mexico and how Mexico enacted 
laws to benefit U.S. businesses, to corroborate the documents that show the problems and challenges faced by

striking workers, 
1892 

2. Posada

suppression of 
protests against

3. Mexican consul

4. Turner 
travelogue 
discussing the 
slave-like 
condition of 
indigenous and 
Asian laborers in 
Yucatan, 1910 

Explains the relevance of point of view (POV), purpose, situation, and/or audience by elaborating 
on examples such as: 
•  By telling striking workers the government is not going to intervene on their behalf, he makes it 
clear the government favors corporate interests and will not help the strikers. (audience) 
Shows the economic philosophy of the Mexican government at the time being in favor of 
unfettered free markets and a noninterventionist, laissez-faire approach to industrial disputes 
which ultimately favored employers and corporate interests. (historical situation) 

• 

The finance minister tells the 
strikers that the problems of the 
workers are not solvable by the 
government, as Mexican law 
prevents interference with 
business practices regarding 
wages, working conditions, etc. 

The cartoon shows mounted 
soldiers violently attacking street 
protesters demonstrating against 
a disputed presidential election. 

• 

• 

The artist shows the protesters sympathetically, meaning the cartoon was intended to criticize 
the government’s actions against them. (purpose) 
Published in a mass-produced and likely cheap news print called “Street Gazette,” the cartoon is 
clearly addressing a very broad section of Mexico’s public. Even those who were illiterate would 
have been able to see the violence and brutality of the government’s suppression of protest in 
the cartoon. (POV/audience) 

•  As a diplomatic representative of the Diaz government, Godoy is focused only on the positive 

aspects of United States investment in Mexico and lavishes praise on Diaz. (POV) 

•  Godoy wants to ensure the continued support of the United States for the Díaz government, so 
he presents a rosy picture of economic progress and social harmony under Díaz’s rule. (purpose) 

Praises the good business 
relations between the U.S. and 
Mexico and the economic 
progress foreign investment has 
allowed in Mexico. Glorifies 
President Díaz as the “right man 
in the right place, at the right 
time” for Mexico. 

•  Discusses how the production of 

henequen on plantations 
involves the use of forced labor 
from indigenous Mexicans and 
Asians and how the workers are 
effectively enslaved by debt 
servitude. 

•  By using the tradition of “muckraking” journalism during the United States Progressive Era, the 
author is trying to get people in the United States to be outraged by the use of what is in effect 
slavery in Mexico. (POV/purpose) 
Since slavery had been abolished in the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere at 
the time the book was published, this author’s use of the term “slavery” to describe the system of 
labor would be deliberately calculated to inflame public opinion. (historical situation)

7. Corrido

the death of 
Revolutionary 
leader Emiliano 
Zapata, 1919 

• 

Shows that United States, British, 
and French investments play a 
very prominent role in Mexico’s 
economy, eclipsing domestic 
Mexican investment in several 
key industries. 

• 

• 

The purpose of the report was to inform the Senate on the levels of United States business 
investment in Mexico. The Senate may have sought that information because of the perceived 
risk to United States investments in Mexico given the growing political instability there. 
(POV/purpose) 
The table shows the heavy concentration of foreign investment in Mexico in those industries that 
relied on exploitation of Mexican natural resources (for example, mines, oil industry, rubber 
industry) or were most likely to be profitable (railways). This investment pattern is the hallmark of 
neocolonialism / economic imperialism. (historical situation) 

•  Attacks the concept of private 
property as opposed to sharing 
common resources by 
highlighting how the indigenous 
communities in Mexico have 
used land together. Advocates 
taking land from large 
landowners and returning it to 
the peasants. 
Praises Zapata for fighting for 
the poor and promises his 
return. Highlights Zapata’s role 
as a champion of the cause of 
the indigenous Mexicans against 
those of European ancestry 
(gachupines). 

• 

•  As an indigenous person himself, the author uses an idealized vision of the traditional indigenous 

communities using land and other resources in common to achieve social harmony, and 
advocates for changing the current economic and political situation along those communal lines. 
(POV) 
Shows the possible influence of the spread of Marxist ideology in its attack on the idea of private 
property and advocating for a return to communalism. (historical situation) 

• 

•  Meant to inspire Zapata’s followers to keep fighting for the cause of the revolution even after 

• 

their leader’s death. (purpose) 
Folk songs were easy to distribute and reproduce and were an effective way of transmitting 
information or propaganda among populations that might not be literate. (audience)

Question 2: Long Essay Question, Economic and Commercial Practices in Afro-Eurasia 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the period circa 1200–1450, commerce along exchange networks such as the Silk Roads, the Indian Ocean, and the trans-Saharan networks involved 
a number of new economic and commercial practices. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which developments in economic and/or commercial practices in Afro-Eurasia affected trade in this 
period.

•  The development of commercial partnerships in the 

Mediterranean region and the Indian Ocean 

•  The development of the ortaq system under the Mongols 

to facilitate commerce across Eurasia 

Example of a statement that earns one point for evidence: 
• 

“The development of specific commercial practices such as 
banking or issuing bills of exchange, letters of credit, or 
paper money occurred in this period.” 

• 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 

support an argument regarding how economic or 
commercial practices in Afro-Eurasia affected trade 
in the period circa 1200–1450. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence: 
• 

“The establishment of specific commercial 
infrastructure such as caravanserai, ports, and 
postal relay stations greatly facilitated trade along 
major trade routes during this period, by providing 
safe resting stations for merchants or speeding up 
written communications between traders living in 
different cities.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence to support the argument that new 
economic and commercial practices affected trade 
in Afro-Eurasia during the period circa 1200–1450) 
“New commercial practices emerged during this 
period as merchants tried to manage the risks of 
long-distance trade. For example, the Mongol ortaq 
system involved merchants forming partnerships 
that involved cooperation both in the actual trade 
of goods and in the financing of trading voyages. 
Likewise, in the Italian city-states, new financial 
practices gave rise to commercial banking and 
letters of credit.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence to support the argument that new 
economic and commercial practices affected trade 
in Afro-Eurasia during the period circa 1200–1450) 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, changes in commercial practices affected trade more significantly in some regions than others; changes in commercial practices significantly 
affected trade across all of Afro-Eurasia.)

“China during the 
Song, Yuan, and Ming 
periods was renowned 
for producing fine 
porcelain, which was 
in high demand as a 
trade item.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 

explain how developments in economic or 
commercial practices affected trade in Afro-Eurasia 
in the period 1200–1450. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the ways in which the construction of 
commercial infrastructure increased regional and 
transregional trade. 

•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or 

volumes were influenced by the introduction of 
new economic practices. 

•  Explaining how new commercial practices affected 

regional trade in similar or different ways. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 
“The Mongols’ development of commercial 
infrastructure, as well as their financial innovations, 
led to a tremendous expansion of Silk Roads trade.” 
(Establishes two types of developments that 
changed trade in the relevant period. This 
statement would need to be followed up with at 
least minimal discussion of the two categories 
introduced.) 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining how new commercial practices were very important in 

leading to an increase in trade in some regions while new commercial 
practices only had a marginal effect on trade in other regions of Afro-
Eurasia. For instance, a response could highlight the changes that 
occurred in the Silk Roads trade as a result of the Mongol conquests 
and their economic policies, while also noting that areas not 
connected directly to the Silk Roads saw limited effects from these 
changes. (Explains nuance, considers both causes and effects, and 
qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as explaining how the introduction of new commercial practices 
in later periods also led to an increase in trade. For instance, a 
response could discuss how the commercial practices of the Song and 
Yuan dynasties led Europeans to seek routes to Asia for access to 
trade goods, which led to the development of transoceanic trade after 
1450. (Explains relevant and insightful connections)

• 

Illustrating that the introduction of new economic practices did not 
always significantly impact trade in some regions because the positive 
economic effects of the introduction of new practices were 
sometimes negated by political events such as war. For instance, a 
response could highlight the rise in prosperity that occurred in the 
Mongol Empire, while qualifying the argument by noting the 
destructiveness of the Mongol conquests—the sack of Baghdad for 
instance—and how this destruction harmed economies and trade in 
the short term. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Demonstrating how the introduction of the same new economic 

practice in different regions led to increased trade in both regions. For 
instance, a response could discuss how the development of letters of 
credit in Europe and China led to economic growth in Song China and 
during the Italian Renaissance. (Corroborates an argument, considers 
both causes and effects)

•  The continued predominance of Arab, Gujarati, Javanese, 

Chinese, and Omani merchants in regional trade 

•  The global silver trade 
•  The commercial and territorial expansion of European 

joint-stock companies 

Example of a statement that earns one point for evidence: 
• 

“The Portuguese used their superior sailing ship 
technology and a system of passes for other countries’ 
merchant ships in an attempt to control the trade on the 
Indian Ocean.” 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 

support an argument regarding how the economies 
of East and/or South Asian states changed in 
response to European expansion in the period 
1450–1750. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence: 
•  “Despite the presence of European ships in the 

Indian Ocean, the vast majority of seagoing trade 
between Asian ports was still done by Asian ships 
and sailors, such as the Gujaratis in the Arabian 
Sea, and the Javanese around the Malay 
peninsula.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence to support the argument that there were 
limits to European impact on Asian economies) 
•  “The arrival of the European chartered companies 
in India changed the balance of economic power. 
These companies not only increasingly controlled 
trade, but also began using their own armies to 
wage war on Indian rulers.”  (Uses evidence to 
support the argument that joint stock trading 
companies changed Asian economies extensively) 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, the continuing importance in the trade of textiles such as silk in the Mughal and Qing empires shows that the economies of South Asia and East 
Asia did not change much because of European expansion; European expansion significantly changed the economies of South and East Asia because Europeans 
became the middlemen of commerce.)

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
explain how the economies of East and/or South 
Asian states changed in response to European 
expansion in the period 1450–1750. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the ways in which European expansion 
affected specific East or South Asian economies. 

•  Explaining how East or South Asian merchants 

changed their commercial practices to adapt to the 
arrival of Europeans. 

•  Explaining regional similarities and differences in 
the economic impact of European expansion in 
South or East Asian states. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
•  “The decline of Mughal authority in the 1700s, 
combined with growing European military 
superiority, allowed the British and French to seize 
control of vital ports and gain control over Indian 
trade. (Identifies both causation and references 
change over time in the discussion of Europeans in 
Mughal India) 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by demonstrating how the arrival of 

Europeans changed some parts of South or East Asian states’ 
economies significantly while affecting other parts minimally. For 
instance, a response could discuss how Europeans established a 
presence in Indian port cities and made significant changes to the 
economies there but had a very limited impact on the interior of India 
during this period. (Explains nuance, considers both causes and 
effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as explaining why the European arrival in the period 1450–1750 
had a more minimal impact in South and East Asia than compared to 
the activities of Europeans in the period 1750–1950. For instance, a 
response could compare the Japanese limitations on European trade 
into the port of Nagasaki in the Tokugawa period with the opening up 
of Japan in the late 1800s and the westernization program and 
industrial development of the Meiji period. (Explains relevant and 
insightful connections)

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating how the arrival of 

Europeans led to minimal changes in the economies of multiple South 
or East Asian states. For instance, a response could discuss the limited 
European influence in some smaller Asian states such as Burma or 
Thailand during this period in comparison to the effects on India, 
Indonesia, and China. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by demonstrating how the changes to the 
economies of South or East Asian states as a result of the arrival of the 
Europeans were connected to broader economic changes. For 
instance, a response could analyze how the British East India 
Company’s entry into the Asian opium trade affected the economies 
of both India and China, or a response could analyze how growing 
European demand for consumer goods such as tea or calico textiles 
led to changes in the economy of South Asia during this period. 
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects)

Question 4: Long Essay Question, Economic Responses to the Great Depression 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the twentieth century, governments responded to economic crises in various ways. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which governments (other than the United States government) changed their economic policies in 
response to the Great Depression.

“After the Second World War 
communism spread rapidly across 
Eastern Europe in regions occupied 
by the Soviet Union.” 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
• 

Identify at least two specific historical examples relevant 
to government responses to the Great Depression. 

Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include 
the following (two examples required): 
•  The crash of the Dow Jones in 1929 
•  High levels of unemployment across Europe 
•  Severe declines in gross domestic product (up to 40% 

decline) in many world regions 

•  Restrictive trade policies imposed by governments 

around the world, such as the imposition of tariffs on 
imports by Great Britain 

Example of a statement that earns 1 point for evidence: 
• 

“In Germany gross domestic product declined 
dramatically during the early 1930s, and the government 
increased its import tariffs.” 

• 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 

support an argument regarding how governments 
changed their economic policies in response to the 
Great Depression. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence: 
• 

“The severity of economic decline in Germany during 
the Great Depression was greater than in many 
other countries because Germany was still under 
obligation to pay war reparations and relied on 
foreign investment. As a result of widespread 
unemployment and poverty, the new Nazi 
government in Germany embarked on a new policy 
of economic self-sufficiency (autarky).” (Uses 
multiple, specific pieces of evidence to support the 
argument that the German government changed its 
economic policies as a result of the Great 
Depression) 
“Great Britain’s economy stagnated during much of 
the 1920s. Labor unrest and strikes raised fears of 
class conflict and political instability. The 
government policies of protectionism and 
abandoning the gold standard were only partially 
effective in addressing the crisis.” (Uses multiple, 
specific pieces of evidence to support the argument 
that the British government changed its economic 
policies as a result of the Great Depression) 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, most governments in Asia and Latin America did not change their economic policies much because they were either under colonial rule, 
dominated by European or American companies, or they did not have the resources to provide significant government assistance; governments in Western 
Europe changed their economic policies significantly by imposing greater regulations on the financial sector, sponsoring large public works projects, and 
creating welfare programs.)

•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning 
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument. 

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
do not use it to frame

“Unemployment 
increased significantly 
during the Great 
Depression.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
explain how governments changed their economic 
policies in response to the Great Depression. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining why the Great Depression led many 

governments to enact or expand their social welfare 
programs. 

•  Explaining how changes in government economic 
policies in response to the Great Depression 
changed the global economy in the 1930s. 
•  Comparing how the Great Depression led to 

different or similar policy responses by different 
governments. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
•  “Some countries responded to the Great Depression 
by embracing nationalism, fascism, and militarism, 
such as in Germany and Japan. Germany expanded 
its military and pursued economic self-sufficiency.” 
(Compares responses to the Great Depression 
enacted by several different governments and 
connects the reaction to a change) 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by arguing that many governments 
adopted social welfare programs in response to the Great Depression 
but tailored them to fit within an overall free-market economic 
system. For example, a response could discuss the welfare policies 
pursued by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, which were aimed at 
limiting or abolishing the strength of independent labor unions, while 
pursuing key goals of the Fascist and Nazi regimes such as encouraging 
pro-natalist social policies. (Explains nuance, considers both causes 
and effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as explaining how the experiences of the Great Depression 
encouraged governments to pursue new economic policies in the 
aftermath of the Depression. For example, a response could argue 
that the partial success of Keynesian economic policies to address the 
effects of the Great Depression led Western European governments 
(for example, the British Labor government) to be more open to the 
idea of directing economic growth through planning, nationalization 
of some industries, and expanding the welfare state in the aftermath 
of the Second World War. (Explains relevant and insightful 
connections)

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that the responses of many 
governments to the Great Depression evolved over time, for example 
in Great Britain the government initially adopted measures to raise 
taxes, hold down wages, and support the Gold Standard before 
switching course and adopting a more active role in promoting 
employment and wage stabilization measures as well as deficit 
spending. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by demonstrating how governments’ 
responses to the Great Depression co-evolved with changing 
economic theories, such as the transition from free-market laissez-
faire philosophy to Keynesian economics. (Corroborates an argument, 
considers both causes and effects)
