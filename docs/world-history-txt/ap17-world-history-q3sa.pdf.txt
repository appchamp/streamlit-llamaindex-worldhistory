0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying AND explaining one way in which industrialization in the period circa 

1750–1900 can be considered an economic turning point in global history. 

•  ONE point for identifying AND explaining one way in which industrialization in the period circa 

1750–1900 can be considered a political turning point in global history.

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  Machine-driven methods of production replaced the traditional ways of creating consumer 

products, making those products more available to consumers. 

•  Factories became the new centers of production and labor demand, replacing the older systems 

and leading to the advent of wage-earning work. 

•  Natural resources from Africa, Asia, and Latin America were extracted and used for factories in 
western Europe and North America, while China’s and India’s share of manufacturing wealth 
declined throughout the nineteenth century.

Short Answer Question 3 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

• 

Industrialized nations pursued imperial expansion and political control over regions in Africa and 
Asia that had previously been independent.  

•  The working class, which had traditionally been denied political power, gained influence as 

movements based on socialism, communism, and Marxism became more prevalent and more 
powerful in some industrialized regions. 

•  Under pressure from unions and other workers’ movements, governments became active in 

improving working conditions and wages. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

• 

Industrialization produced migrations of people, either to cities within industrializing areas or 
around the globe, to take advantage of new industrialization.  

•  Pollution and poor living conditions resulting from industrialization led to movements to improve 

urban environments. 

•  Traditional class structures had divided landowners and agricultural workers, but industrialization 
introduced a new divide between an industrial working class of factory laborers and a middle class 
of factory managers, professionals, and bureaucrats. 

•  Women moved into factory jobs, which propelled the movement for additional women’s rights.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 3 

Overview 

This question asked students to identify and explain three ways in which industrialization in the period 
circa 1750−1900 can be considered an economic turning point in global history: one economic, one 
political, and one social. The question assessed students’ ability to recognize how the process of 
industrialization had long-term consequences across the globe. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned the point for explaining how industrial textile production led to a change in the 
patterns of global production and wealth and thereby represented an economic turning point in global 
history. 

b) The response earned the point for explaining how industrialization led to western European colonization in 
Asia and Africa and thereby represented a political turning point in global history. 

c) The response earned the point for explaining how industrialization in Europe and the United States led to 
the establishment of new laws designed to protect workers’ rights and improve working conditions and 
thereby represented a social turning point in global history. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned the point for explaining how mechanization resulted in the replacement of “skilled 
workers with unskilled workers,” the reduction of wages, and the “faster production of goods” and thereby 
represented an economic turning point in global history. 

b) The response did not earn the point because it does not sufficiently explain how the introduction of 
capitalist ideas represented a political turning point in global history. 

c) The response earned the point for explaining how industrialization created the conditions for women to 
obtain low-skilled factory work, which subsequently led women to advocate for greater rights, representing a 
social turning point in global history. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned the point for sufficiently explaining how “cheaper and easier” methods of production 
and transportation led to greater economic wealth and thereby represented an economic turning point in 
global history. 

b) The response did not earn the point because while it identifies the emergence of reforms stemming from 
poor working conditions, it does not sufficiently explain how those reforms reflected a political turning point 
in global history. 

c) The response did not earn the point because while it identifies improvements in transportation and 
communication, it does not explain how those improvements reflected a social turning point in global history.
