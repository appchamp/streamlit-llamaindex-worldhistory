2010 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

The intent of the question was for students to pick two of the stipulated empires — Han China (206 B.C.E. 
to 220 C.E.), Mauryan/Gupta India (320 B.C.E. to 550 C.E.), Imperial Rome (31 B.C.E. to 476 C.E.) — and 
compare the ways those empires exerted political control over their populaces. Students were explicitly 
told to discuss both similarities and differences in methods of political control. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 8 

The essay contains a valid thesis in the second and third sentences of the first paragraph (1 point). In the 
fourth paragraph, the essay addresses a similarity (“Both empires had unstable borders”) and several 
differences, including “However, Han China dealt with the Turkic Huns through the tribute systems, thus 
placating them with gifts and avoiding costly & expensive warfare, which Rome preferred when dealing 
with their enemies” (2 points). Although there is ample evidence for the Han, Roman evidence is limited 
by discussion of the Republic, which could not be counted. There is, however, enough evidence for 2 
evidence points. In addition to the direct comparison listed above, there is another difference at the 
bottom of the second paragraph — “However, because there was less emphasis as a collective group in 
Rome, the political organization was a lot less structured than China’s” — which earned 1 point for the 
comparison and 1 point because the statement also involves an analysis. This essay contained a complex 
thesis, sufficient depth of comparison, and supporting evidence to earn 1 Expanded Core point. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 6 

This essay contains a valid thesis in the first paragraph (1 point) and addresses both similarities and 
differences (2 points). There is sufficient evidence for both the Mauryan/Gupta and the Han empires (2 
points). The direct comparison is found in the second paragraph: “Han China and Maurya Gupta [sic] both 
consolidated their power through military buildup” (1 point). The essay attempts analysis in the next to 
the last paragraph but only analyzes the Han: “Due to their lack of a devout religion, China was able to 
assimilate the Huns when they began to invade China.” There is no analysis of a comparison of Han and 
Mauryan/Gupta methods of political control. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 3 

There is no valid thesis because the essay attempts to show a difference between Han and Rome in terms 
of the Roman Republic, which is outside the time period. The essay only addresses similarities, not valid 
differences (1 point). The evidence is sufficient for the Han, but the only valid piece of evidence for Rome 
is the statement that “He [Augustus] defeated Cleopatra and Mark Anthony making sure that Rome is 
politically secured” (1 point).  Most of the Roman evidence is prior to 31 B.C.E. and therefore did not earn 
credit.  The essay has a valid direct comparison in the fourth paragraph: “The size of both empires was an 
issue that led to leaders ultimately losing political control of both empires” (1 point).
