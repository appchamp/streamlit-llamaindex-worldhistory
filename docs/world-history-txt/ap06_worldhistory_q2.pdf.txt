2006 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2—Continuity/Change Over Time 

Overview 

Students were to discuss and analyze significant changes and continuities in political structures and 
institutions, and in cultural practices and institutions, during the late classical period in one of three 
civilizations: Chinese, Roman, or Indian. In all three, this era saw the breakdown of centralized political 
institutions due to internal problems and external threats. Students were to place these developments 
within a world historical context.  

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The essay presents the thesis in the first two sentences, with the first sentence discussing change and the 
second continuities (1 point). The essay discusses both change and continuity in the time period  
(2 points). It provides evidence of political changes associated with the fall of the Gupta Empire and of 
several cultural continuities, including Hinduism, the caste system, and artistic styles (2 points). It 
provides two types of world context with a discussion of the Hun invasions and a comparison of late-
classical India with Rome and China (1 point). It analyzes the unusual political unity of the Gupta period 
and the role of the caste system in providing stability (1 point). The essay earned an expanded core point 
for its especially strong discussion of continuities (1 point). 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 6 

The thesis of the essay does not address continuities, so it did not receive the thesis point. It discusses 
both changes and continuities in the time period (2 points). The essay provides evidence for a number of 
political changes, including political instability, the division of the Roman Empire, and the government’s 
inability to collect taxes effectively. The essay also provides evidence of political continuities, particularly 
in terms of the Byzantine Empire, and of cultural changes, focusing on Christianity (2 points). World 
context is brought in with a discussion of the Hun invasions (1 point). The essay analyzes ways in which 
many different factors led to the decline of the Western Empire and why Constantine’s actions led more 
people to become Christian (1 point).   

Sample: 2C 
Score: 3 

The essay does not have a valid thesis—the first sentence is insufficiently qualified. It discusses changes 
and continuities in the time period (2 points). The essay only provides accurate evidence of cultural 
changes, especially the challenge of Buddhism, and of cultural continuities, including Hinduism and the 
caste system (1 point). No political evidence and no discussion of world historical context in the time 
frame of the question are provided, as the Mongols and the spread of Islam to India are out of the period. 
There is no analysis of the causes of change or continuity.
