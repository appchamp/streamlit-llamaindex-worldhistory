Student Performance Q&A: 

2013 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2013 free-response questions for AP® World History were written by 
the Chief Reader, Dean T. Ferguson, Texas A&M University–Kingsville, Texas; and the following 
Question Leaders and Exam Leaders: Tammy Proctor, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio; 
William Zeigler, San Marcos High School, San Marcos, California; Deborah Wing-Leonard, Clear Lake 
High School, Houston, Texas; Kathy Callahan, Murray State University, Murray, Kentucky; Richard 
Warner, Wabash College, Wabash, Indiana; Dixie Grupe, Hickman High School, Columbia, Missouri. 
They give an overview of each free-response question and of how students performed on the 
question, including typical student errors. General comments regarding the skills and content that 
students frequently have the most problems with are included. Some suggestions for improving 
student performance in these areas are also provided. Teachers are encouraged to attend a College 
Board workshop to learn strategies for improving student performance in specific areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

Students were asked to analyze the connections between regional issues and European struggles for global 
power in the mid-18th century. The Seven Years’ War was clearly the global struggle that was meant to 
frame student answers, yet this was not stated in the historical background or explicitly stated in the 
documents. Students with deep knowledge of 18th century world, United States, or European history 
successfully understood the context of the question. The wording of the question led some students to 
group the documents geographically or to frame their responses as a purely European phenomenon. 
Although a map was given to help the students place the global areas identified in the documents, a 
historical description of the Seven Years’ War may have helped students better understand the context of 
the documents. 

Most of the source attributions gave students ample opportunity to assess point of view and to explain the 
need for an additional document. A lack of visual or quantitative sources provided students with an 
obvious choice for an additional document. 

The scoring guidelines asked students to make connections between regional issues and European 
struggles for global power only in the thesis, while all other score points could be earned by focusing on 
either regional issues or European struggles for global power. 

How well did students perform on this question? 

Students performed poorly on this question and lacked the overall framework of the 18th century and the 
Seven Years’ War, which might have assisted them in responding to the question. Students with deep 
knowledge of the 18th-century world or with a solid grounding in United States, or European history were

able to better contextualize the documents and effectively analyze point of view, but students without this 
background were at a disadvantage. The unadjusted mean was on a 0 to 9 score range. The mean score 
was 2.11 out of a possible 9 points. Although many students attempted to answer the question, they were 
confused by many of the documents and how to connect the documents to either a regional issue or a 
European struggle for global power. It is notable that many students chose to answer this question last and 
this may imply either that they lacked confidence in answering the question or that teachers have 
encouraged their students to answer the DBQ last as a strategy for finishing the exam.  

Students who performed well on this question generally discussed the connections between regional 
issues and European struggles for global power, and used the connections to build an overall framework in 
which to discuss the documents. The better essays moved away from a formulaic grouping strategy (i.e., 
political, social, economic) and instead developed groupings that identified either regional conflicts that 
led to global struggles or global struggles that resulted in regional conflicts. It is gratifying to see that more 
and more students are attempting to perform all of the tasks demanded in the question (additional 
document, point of view, and grouping), although more work is needed to improve their abilities in 
completing these tasks successfully. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Generally, the errors or omissions clustered in two areas: lack of close reading of the documents and lack of 
understanding or information about the broader historical context. This led to concerns in each of the six 
core points. 

  Core point 1: Although many students did attempt a thesis, in order to receive this point, 

students needed to make an explicit connection between regional issues and European struggles 
for global power. This proved to be a higher bar and one of the most difficult core points for 
students to demonstrate competence. 

  Core point 2: Students tended to address all nine documents, although some students skipped a 
single document, often openly stating the omission. Students had difficulty understanding some of 
the more complex documents (documents 5, 6, 8, and 9), in many cases misreading either the 
attribution or the document itself. Students did not pay close attention to the document dates and 
did not use those dates to help categorize the documents for grouping. 

  Core point 3: Students who understood the documents generally analyzed the documents in 
relationship to either a regional issue or a European struggle for global power. However, many 
students still used direct quoting of the document as sufficient to show evidence and therefore did 
not earn evidence points. Misreading of documents led to misinterpretations and 
misunderstandings of the states and people involved as well as their different allegiances. 
  Core point 4: Although many students did attempt to discuss point of view for the documents, 
they still did not successfully provide analysis. A few confused interpretation of the document as 
explanations of the document’s point of view or made vague statements about bias or reliability 
based simply on restating the attribution of the document without endeavoring to provide any form 
of analysis. As in previous years, students were expected to situate the author or tone of the 
document. Having done this in some cases, students still did not provide an adequate rationale for 
their claim about perspective. As a result, while students attempted to discuss the point of view of 
the documents, many still did not earn this point.  

  Core point 5: Students had to place the documents in groups based on either a regional issue or 

European struggles for global power. The rubric allowed geographic and thematic grouping as a 
reflection of the wording of the question. As always, students did not receive this point for listing 
documents in a group; they needed to make explicit connections between the documents to show 
grouping.

  Core point 6: Students often asked for another point of view or a document that was potentially 

relevant but often did not explain how the addition of this document would enhance understanding 
of either regional issues or European struggles for global power.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Teachers should be commended for having their students address all of the requirements of the DBQ. 
However, teachers need to continue to model and allocate time to practice parsing the question and 
addressing all of the requirements within the context of the tasks posed by the question. For example, 
students understood the need to discuss the regional issues and European struggles for global power, but 
did not analyze the connections between the two in the thesis, evidence, grouping, or additional 
document. As has been stated in the past, more needs to be done to enforce the point of view and 
additional document requirements as analytical tools throughout the course and not just a requirement for 
this exam. The same should be said for document analysis, since many of the students presented a 
surface-level view of the documents, which often led to misstatements or outright misunderstandings. 

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

This question asked students to analyze how political transformations contributed to changes and 
continuities in the cultures of the Mediterranean region during the period circa 200 C.E. to circa 1000 C.E. 
Students were expected to provide historical evidence to support a discussion of change and continuity as 
impacted by political transformations in the Mediterranean within the time period. Further, students were 
to analyze world historical context by identifying regions outside the Mediterranean that shaped political 
transformations that contributed to cultural change and continuity. The AP® World History course is 
designed to support student learning of four key historical thinking skills, one of which is ‘‘the ability to 
recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and change over periods of time of 
varying length, as well as relating these patterns to larger historical processes or themes.’’ Additionally, 
AP® World History is anchored by five course themes. Although this question aligns with many of them, it 
is explicitly aligned with Theme 2: Development and Interaction of Cultures and Theme 3: State-Building, 
Expansion, and Conflict. The question provided an opportunity for students to demonstrate both an 
understanding of historical content and the application of historical thinking skills.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 1.03 out of a possible 9 points. 

Students demonstrated considerable knowledge of political transformations in the Mediterranean region 
within the time period (i.e., fall of the Roman Empire, rise of the Byzantine Empire, rise and spread of the 
Islamic empires, and political fragmentation in western Europe) and some knowledge of how those political 
transformations contributed to changes and continuities in culture(s) in the region. Some essays contained 
sophisticated discussions of political changes that demonstrated understanding of the process of change 
and continuity over time in the culture(s) of the region. At times the change and continuity was accurately 
attributed to a political transformation, and essays were often able to analyze the world historical context of 
those changes and continuities. Unfortunately, many responses were comparisons of political 
transformations or cultural features between separate regions within the Mediterranean rather than 
analyses of changes and continuities in a culture within the region(s). Additionally, many responses were 
unable to link political transformations to either cultural change or continuity. Many essays also included a 
comparison of political transformations in regions outside the Mediterranean region with no specified

connection to the Mediterranean region (i.e., the Mayan Empire or Han China). Many essays also included 
evidence and discussions of historical events outside of the specified time period or outside the 
Mediterranean region. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

One of the most common errors was not addressing all parts of the question. Because of the two-tiered 
complexity of the prompt, many students failed to address both political transformations and their 
contributions to change and/or continuity in culture(s). Other students were able to effectively identify a 
change or continuity, but were unable to address both. Finally, many student responses compared political 
transformations between distinct regions within the Mediterranean, for example comparing the 
consequences of political change in Western Europe (the decline of Rome, emergence of feudal 
institutions) with political conditions in the Byzantine Empire (the persistence of Roman institutions) 
without clearly addressing change and/or continuity of the cultures affected by these political changes.  

Some students restated the prompt as their thesis, pointedly including the words “political 
transformations,” but without stating specific events. Changes and continuities were often unspecified as 
well. If students did not address the prompt in the thesis, this often, but not always, meant that they were 
likely to be unable to address all parts of the question in other parts of their response. For students to earn 
1 point for thesis and 2 points for addressing the question, they had to specify at least one political 
transformation that contributed to one change and one continuity in the culture(s) in the region within the 
specified time period.  

The vast majority of responses generally acknowledged key political transformations in the region within 
the time period. Students often referenced the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, the fragmentation of 
power in western Europe, the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, the political expansion of the Umayyad 
Empire, and the shift of power from the Umayyad Dynasty to the Abbasids. Many responses likewise 
addressed changes in the ethnic composition of the region, changes in the religious beliefs of the region 
and emergence of new religious practices, changes in language and literacy, new art forms, and changes 
in architectural style and function during this time period. However, many students did not explicitly link 
these cultural changes to specific political transformations.  

In general, students provided historical evidence that demonstrated they had a generic knowledge of 
culture and politics in the Mediterranean region between 200 C.E. to 1000 C.E., but few students were able 
to integrate both components of the prompt to discuss the impact of political transformations on cultural 
change or continuity.  

This year, as in previous years, most students struggled with analysis. Many essays did not sufficiently 
analyze or explain change or continuity across the specified time period. Some students ineffectively 
sought to explain a change or a continuity in culture(s) by coupling it with statement about political 
transformations, yet without explicitly stating how that political transformation led to the specified cultural 
change. For example, a statement about the fall of the Roman Empire might reference the spread of 
Christianity without specifying how the fall of the Roman Empire contributed to that spread. It was not 
enough to assume that the reader would recognize the connection.  

Analysis of global historical context was tied explicitly to how outside regions shaped a political 
transformation’s contribution to cultural change or continuity. Many students made references to outside 
regions with no connection to Mediterranean political transformations or cultural changes and 
continuities. Many students also made direct comparisons with events or developments outside the 
Mediterranean, which, while perhaps providing interesting parallels with developments within the 
Mediterranean region, did not have a direct bearing upon either the political transformations or changes 
and continuities of culture in the Mediterranean.

Students often included terminology related to Christianity and Islam that placed their evidence outside 
the time period. For example, some essays inappropriately referred to Muslims as Turks or even Mongols. 
Often, students were unsuccessful in delineating between the political features of the Islamic empires and 
the cultural components of those empires. Many students confused economic behavior with political 
change and cultural transformation. For example, students who asserted that one of the changes resulting 
from political transformations in the Mediterranean was a decline in trade in Western Europe had not 
effectively linked political transformation to cultural change or continuity, unless they could demonstrate 
an understanding of the way in which declining trade reflected other features of cultural life. Although 
some students effectively demonstrated how political transformations contributed to change or continuity 
in economic features of Mediterranean cultural life, others concluded by simply identifying economic 
impacts of the political change, and thus did not complete the task.  

Finally, among the primary pitfalls for students answering this question remained problems of 
periodization, chronological sequencing, and lack of basic geographical knowledge. Errors in each of these 
areas often sabotaged the evidence students sought to bring to bear to answer the question. Many 
students included historical evidence that was not only out of the specified time period, but also out of the 
specified regions (e.g., discussion of cultural changes in India or northern Europe, the Crusades, Julius 
Caesar, Alexander the Great, the building of railroads, the role of the Mongols, Turks, etc.). 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Pay particular attention to teaching students to deconstruct the question before they begin writing their 
responses. This year, many students seemed to miss or ignore the two-part nature of the prompt and 
instead wrote essays that addressed change and continuity in culture(s) in the Mediterranean within the 
time period without explicitly and directly linking those cultural changes or continuities to a specific 
political transformation. Or, students discussed in accurate detail the political transformations in the 
region without explicitly and directly linking them to changes or continuities in the culture of the region. 
There were also many essays that compared specific political transformations within the Mediterranean or 
compared regional cultural changes and continuities. Encourage students to read the prompt carefully and 
perhaps rewrite it word-by-word or circle key words. This strategy encourages students to focus on what 
the prompt is asking them to address and is fundamentally useful for all learners. 

Continue to reinforce student understanding of periodization and chronology. Classroom strategies that 
support student learning about change and continuity over time include using timelines and creating 
change/continuity tables. Drawing on the curriculum framework, teachers should encourage students to 
create graphic organizers that will help them display the big picture globally, in relation to the main course 
themes, and simultaneously take notes on the illustrative examples or historical evidence of those themes. 
One approach may be to have students create change/continuity tables for each time period and each 
theme. For example, during a unit that covers the period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E., students might be required to 
identify, describe, and analyze changes and continuities in each of the five course themes. An activity or 
assignment like this may also be constructed to provide opportunities for students to work in cooperative 
learning groups; small groups may be assigned different themes and collaborate to complete the 
assignment. Each group could be required to create a poster with that information that could be displayed 
in the room for the remainder of the year and serve as a study tool later during review. If teachers engaged 
students in this type of activity during a unit, summative assessments at the end of the unit might include 
a change-and-continuity-over-time (CCOT) essay modeled after those used on previous exams. Further, 
charts identifying changes and continuities from prior and later periods may also be instructive, as this 
essay might suggest. Teachers should also encourage their students to develop a vocabulary which 
enables them to make assertions about change and continuity and to analyze those changes and 
continuities. Mere juxtaposition of information in contiguous sentences or phrases does not effectively 
demonstrate the evidence of connections or explanations of why or how changes take place or continuities

persist. Student-created charts which develop the vocabulary for indicating change, continuity, and 
analysis should be displayed and used as review materials as students practice writing essays. 

Continue to link the development of analytical writing skills to the CCOT question by helping students 
situate changes and continuities within the context of wider world historical processes. Practice this skill 
in isolation in the classroom to help prepare students do this well on the exam. Teachers could have 
students present their change/continuity posters to the class and then engage the class in a discussion of 
the world historical context for the changes or continuities their students are identifying. This activity 
could even be staged as a game or as a formative assessment. The key is to create opportunities for 
students to learn historical content and develop these historical thinking and writing skills. Use essay 
questions from previous exams (available on AP® Central) in class as often as possible at appropriate 
intervals. There are many past CCOT questions that can be used to either teach content or to assess 
student understanding at the end of units. Each essay question has an operational scoring guide that 
accompanies it, as well as sample student essays. Assigning the questions to students and using the 
scoring guides to provide feedback to students is one of the best ways to support the development of 
historical and analytical writing skills. Analysis is an enduring skill in the AP® World History course, and 
learning how to prepare students to think, read, and write analytically should continue to be the focus of 
teacher professional development. 

Question 3  

What was the intent of this question? 

The question asked students to identify and explain similarities and differences between the role of the 
state in the economic development of Japan and in one other country (China, the Ottoman Empire, or 
Russia) during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In particular, the question measured the historical 
thinking skill of comparison and contextualization (Skill 3) and Key Concept 5.1 (Industrialization and 
Global Capitalism), sections II and V. The question assessed content and thematic knowledge of portions 
of Period 5 (1750–1900) and Period 6 (1900–present). The question specifically focuses on Themes 4 and 3: 
“Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems” and “State-Building, Expansion, and 
Conflict.’’ 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 1.42 out of a possible 9 points. Many students seemed to know a fair amount about 
the countries in question during this period, as well as before and after the specified time period. There 
were relatively few blank booklets, and this question was frequently answered first. Though the mean 
score was low, numerous students did author excellent essays that directly related state policies to 
economic development in the chosen regions. 

That said, much of the information students marshaled to answer the question was not tied directly to 
addressing the role of states' policy on their different economies, which lowered scores on several rubric 
points. For example, students often wrote about the cultural, political, and military histories of the regions 
without any reference to the state’s influence on economic development. Thus, they were able to write 
long essays that often did not directly address the prompt. On the other hand, some of the stronger exams 
managed to apply some of this otherwise off-topic information to the prompt, in effect, establishing a 
historical context for the question. For example, better students often situated their analysis of state efforts 
to industrialize in explanations of such cultural concepts as “Westernization.” 

One of the more difficult tasks, as is often the case, is the specific aim of this question, and that is 
developing explicit direct comparisons. Only a small group of students were successfully able to explicitly 
make direct comparisons between the two states and economic developments in the specified states. 
Students did receive the rubric point for analysis from statements that students presented as direct

comparisons. The analysis point in the rubric required that a student explain why a direct similarity or 
difference occurred, in either state policy or economic development, based on valid historical information 
from each state. The direct comparison point of the rubric, by contrast, required a more complete 
statement, which differed from that stated in the introductory paragraph’s thesis statement, of a 
comparison between the role of state policy and economic development in Japan with state policy and 
economic development in the chosen second state. Moreover, since these two rubric points are so directly 
interconnected, often students who wrote nuanced comparisons accompanied by analysis earned two 
expanded-core points on the nine-point scale.  

Most essays attempted to provide evidence, but this was often off-topic. When students did write on the 
topic, the essays were often in the mid-to-high range or better. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

The most frequent error was misreading the prompt, which in turn affected students’ ability to write 
effective thesis statements. This also meant that students had difficulty addressing the entire question, 
and providing valid, relevant evident.  

A successful thesis statement identified valid differences and similarities in the role of state action in the 
economy in both Japan and the chosen state. A successful thesis then needed to address valid differences 
and similarities in both regions, qualifying these beyond the language of the prompt. For example, to 
simply claim that both states were modernized would not be acceptable for the similarity half of the thesis, 
or for addressing similarities. However, a thesis statement that failed to address both similarities and 
differences, but which did accurately identify one or the other could still earn one rubric point for 
“addressing” all parts of the question. (Keep in mind that to earn the second “addressing” point, the 
student would have to elsewhere identify the other, whether a similarity or a difference). 

Most students did offer examples of similarities or differences between Japan and the chosen state in their 
essays, though many of these were not credited because the difference or similarity was not specifically 
about the relationship between the state and economic development. Students needed to address how the 
state was an active force in the process of economic development. This proved to be a problem for the 
interpretation of evidence as well, which often drifted from the main topic. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Most importantly, students should learn to “attack the prompt.” Far more mistakes were made as a 
consequence of misunderstanding the question than for any other single reason. While it is possible that 
some students did not know much about the state’s involvement in economic development, and therefore 
offered so much off-topic information, it is also likely that some misread the prompt and did not write what 
they did know about the subject.  

Since the skill being assessed in this essay is comparison, most successful essays were organized around 
the task of identifying and comparing similarities and differences in state policy actions or economic 
patterns rather than by making the centerpiece of organization the distinction between the two specific 
nations. In other words, students who wrote essay paragraphs that sequentially described one state 
followed by their alternative choice tended to find it difficult to earn the addressing points for similarity or 
difference, and usually earned only the evidence points.  

Teachers would be well advised to continue to work on thesis-writing with students. Of course, this is an 
acquired skill, one that when learned will often lead to stronger essays. Students should address the major 
parts of the prompt, qualifying their claim in a way that moves beyond the prompt itself. For example:

“While both Japan and Russia eventually followed the West in developing an industrial sector of their 
economy, Japan did so earlier than Russia, in the wake of Western incursions in the 19th century.” 

Students can learn to make their comparisons more complex, and develop an explanation for these claims 
to receive credit for Direct Comparison and Analysis. An example of a Direct Comparison: “The weakened 
and embattled Ottoman Empire was not able to industrialize as well as Japan did following the state 
reforms of the Meiji Restoration.” An example of a weaker comparison that would be accepted as 
addressing difference: “Unlike Japan, the Ottomans were not able to effectively industrialize.” In the former 
case, the student could earn a point for analysis with an explanation as to the reasons for the difference. 
For example: “This is because political bickering by Young Turks and European incursions prevented the 
Ottomans from developing economically, while the unity of purpose behind the Meiji Restoration 
encouraged economic development.” Successful analyses are often longer than this example, though short 
ones such as this one are acceptable. The use of key transition terms such as “due to” or “because” will 
often lead to successful analysis. The Analysis point is only possible in reference to a specific, valid Direct 
Comparison. Analysis that explains vague or weak similarities and differences is not credited with the 
analysis point. 

In sum, student performance can be helped most by careful attention to the essay prompt. A thorough 
understanding of terms used in essay prompts can guide student efforts in gathering or remembering 
appropriate evidence and making valid comparisons.
