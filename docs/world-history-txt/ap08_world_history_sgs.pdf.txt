BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis.  

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address at least two factors that shaped the modern Olympics. 
•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay. 
•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs or merely restates the prompt is

(May misinterpret 1 document.) 

•  Students must address all 10 documents in the essay. 
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of at least 9  

documents. 

•  Documents must be addressed individually to show understanding in a way that goes  

beyond listing and attribution.

1 Point 

3.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but 1 document. 

2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Evidence must be drawn from 9 or 10 documents and address the question.

1 Point

and explaining the tone, the characteristics and experiences of the author, the
