                       Question 1  

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1. Has acceptable thesis 

0-7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address at least two relationships between gender and politics in 
Latin America in the twentieth century plausibly drawn from the documents.   

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or specified in the 

conclusion of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple consecutive sentences. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count in any other category.  

2. Understands the basic meaning of documents  
•  Students must address all 10 of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate an understanding of the basic meaning of at least nine 

1 Point 

documents.  

•  Students may demonstrate the basic meaning of a document by grouping it in 

regard to a relationship between gender and politics.  

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without context 

does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document  

1-2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a relationship between gender and politics must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a relationship between gender and politics must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

4. Analyzes point of view in at least two documents 

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two documents.  
•  Point of view explains why this individual might have this opinion or what feature 

1 Point 

informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description, perhaps by explaining a document’s 
tone, the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion (or some combination of these). 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, but 

they must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing 
some plausible analysis of how or why.  

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying verbatim or only repeating 

information from the source line of the document.

•  Students must explicitly and correctly group the documents in three ways 

demonstrating a relationship between gender and politics.  

6. Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional  
    document or source 

•  Students must identify an appropriate additional document, source, or voice and 

explain how or why the document or source will contribute to analysis of a
