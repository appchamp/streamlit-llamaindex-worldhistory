Question 4 — Long Essay Question 

“In the period after 1900, the role of the state in the economy varied, with many states adopting policies to 
control or manage their economies. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in this 
time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the thesis must make 
a claim that responds to the prompt, 
rather than merely restating or rephrasing 
the prompt. The thesis must consist of 
one or more sentences located in one 
place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.  

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which one or more 
states controlled their economies in the period after 
1900, with some indication of the reasoning for making 
that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, 
but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 
Examples: 
• 

“The twentieth century included several examples 
of states controlling their economies, the most 
famous being that of the Soviet Union, which used 
Marxist ideology to justify its nationalization of 
industry and introduction of centralized economic 
planning.” (Responds to the prompt with an 
evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“In recent years, many countries rejected the idea of 
trying to control their economies and embraced free 
market capitalism.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 

• 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the development of states and 
economic policy in the period after 1900. 

To earn this point, the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.  

Example: 
• 

“World War I upset the global political and 
economic order and led to the establishment of new 
totalitarian states.” (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic.)

least two specific historical examples relevant to the 
extent of states’ control of their economies in the period 
after 1900.

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence. (2 points)  

Example (acceptable): 
• 

“Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward is one of the 
best examples of communist states controlling their 
economies.” (Counts toward earning the point 
because there is a specific historical example relevant 
to the prompt.) 

Example (unacceptable): 
• 

“In the period after 1900, different states took 
different approaches to economic policy, with some 
states attempting to control while other states 
merely seeking to manage their national 
economies.” (Does not count toward earning the 
point because there is no specific information beyond 
what is provided in the introductory statement.) 

OR 

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument 
in response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., some states 
make little or no effort to control their economies, while 
other states try to impose considerable or full control of 
the economy), then the response can earn the second 
evidence point by using only one specific historical 
example for each part of the multipart argument (but the 
total number of examples used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  Communist states such as the Soviet Union and 

China exercised great control over their economies 
by collectivizing agriculture and Five-Year Plans. 

•  Fascist states (including Japan) in the interwar 
period developed corporatist economic policies 
where state officials and representatives of big 
business cooperated in guiding economic policy 
and setting production targets in some economic 
sectors, while preserving the basic structure of a 
capitalist economy.

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•  Partly in response to the two world wars and the 
Great Depression, many Western states also 
increased their level of intervention in the economy, 
by more actively promoting economic development 
projects, adopting some level of economic planning, 
and launching social welfare programs. 

•  Beginning in the 1980s, the growing emphasis on 
neoliberal, free market economic policies led some 
countries, notably the United States and Great 
Britain, to return to less interventionist economic 
policies. 

•  After decolonization, many newly independent 

states in Asia, Africa, and the Americas pursued 
interventionist (sometimes socialist) economic 
policies and attempted to guide their countries’ 
economic development. 

Especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, 
international economic organizations such as the IMF 
and World Bank restricted some governments’ ability to 
control their economies by imposing Western economic 
practices. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain the extent 
to which one or more states controlled their economies in 
the period after 1900. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining the role of ideologies and economic 
theories, such as Marxism, neoliberalism, or 
Keynesian economics, in informing states’ 
economic policies in the twentieth century 
•  Explaining the role of new technologies, such as 

mass media or the Internet, on states’ ability to 
control or direct their economies 

•  Explaining the role of economic cycles in increasing 
or lowering the appeal of ideas and policies of 
government economic regulations 

•  Explaining the role of wars and wartime resource 
mobilization on governments’ ability and/or 
willingness to regulate the national economy 

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (1 point) 

To earn the first point, the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about the extent to which one 
or more states controlled their economies 
in the period after 1900.

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt. (2 points) 

To earn the second point, the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the extent to which one 
or more states controlled their economies 
in the period after 1900. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument that discusses how 
economic globalization and the increasingly 
international nature of economic production and 
consumption is diminishing the importance of the 
nation state as an economic actor. 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
even states that attempted to control their 
economies completely sometimes relaxed their 
control and allowed some measure of private 
economic initiative (as seen in the examples of the 
NEP and perestroika policies in the Soviet Union or 
in China following the liberalization policies of 
Deng Xiaoping). Alternatively, even states that 
subscribe to free market economic principles 
sometimes adopt aspects of economic control (as 
seen in the examples of various wartime planning 
boards and the nationalization of many pension and 
medical insurance schemes in Western countries). 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections 

across time and space, such as explaining why the 
economic policies of the nineteenth centuries 
became discredited in the early twentieth century 
and then partly returned to favor in the late 
twentieth century.  

This demonstration of complex understanding must be 
part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in the 
period after 1900. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period but must identify a relevant development or 
developments that originated in the period. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

“The twentieth century included several examples of states controlling their economies, the most 
famous being that of the Soviet Union, which used Marxist ideology to justify its nationalization of 
industry and introduction of centralized economic planning.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative 
claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 

•  While some states after 1900, such as communist Russia and China, exercised great control over their 
economies, the United States and many Western European believed in implementing more free-market 
policies. (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“In recent years, many countries rejected the idea of trying to control their economies and embraced 
free market capitalism.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line 
of reasoning.) 

• 

•  Communist countries fully regulated their economies. (Responds to the prompt with a minimally 

acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

In the period since 1900, many states have attempted to control their economies, to one extent or 
another.” (Offers a historically defensible claim but includes no additional information beyond what is 
provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Economic policy in the period after 1900 has been dominated by the debate over mercantilism versus 
free trade.” (Not a historically defensible claim.)  
“The global nature of financial markets and the emergence of multinational corporations in the late 
twentieth century led to staggering economic inequalities between the haves and the have-nots.” 
(Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference specific state economic policy relevant to 
economic control.)  
“The economies of Russia and China were communist.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does 
not reference specific state economic policy relevant to economic control.) 
“Many countries in this period fully controlled their economies.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt but 
does not reference a specific country or policy.) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame after 1900. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the development of states and 
economic policy in the period after 1900. 

Examples of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“As shown by the experiences of the 1800s, unregulated capitalism could lead to periodic economic 
crises and create persistent social problems having to do with poverty, crime, and urban sprawl. Many 
economists and politicians came to believe that some form of government economic regulation was 
needed to manage or prevent such problems.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 
“The Great Depression convinced many economists and politicians, as well as the general population 
of many countries, that the free market could not be relied upon to self-correct or always deliver 
economic prosperity.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“Hitler never forgot Germany’s harrowing experience with hyperinflation.” (Potentially relevant but is 
merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe.”) 

•  The carnage of World War I showed colonized people everywhere that Europe had lost the moral claim 

to be a world leader.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to economic policies or economic 
changes.)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the extent of states control of their 
economies in the period after 1900. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to 
earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.  

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward is one of the best examples of communist states controlling their 
economies.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt.) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“In the period after 1900, different states took different approaches to economic policy, with some 
states attempting to control while other states merely seeking to manage their national economies.” 
(Does not count toward earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided 
in the introductory statement.) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which one or more states controlled their economies in the period after 
1900. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“In early-twentieth-century Japan, the state attempted to control the economy indirectly, by supporting 
and partnering with large private companies called zaibatsu which were given favorable tax rates and 
tariff protection in exchange for developing heavy industry, which the state needed for its military 
expansion. In Nazi Germany too, the government used indirect measures to control and direct the 
economy, The Nazis established close ties with leading German manufacturers and banks many of 
whom had lucrative government military contracts. In exchange for their cooperation, these companies 
and banks were given a free hand to deal with labor unions workers’ demands.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt.)

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which one or more states controlled their economies in the period after 1900. To earn this point, the 
response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the 
reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining the role of ideologies and economic theories, such as Marxism, neoliberalism, or Keynesian 

economics, in informing states’ economic policies in the twentieth century 

•  Explaining the role of new technologies, such as mass media or the Internet, on states’ ability to control

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the extent to which states controlled 
their economies in the period after 1900, by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the question.  

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or

Question 4 — Long Essay Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the extent to which states in the twentieth 
and early twenty-first century controlled their economies. The question primarily addressed Key Concept 6.3.I 
(“The role of the state in the domestic economy varied, and new institutions of global association emerged and 
continued to develop throughout the century”). The question provided opportunities for students to 
demonstrate two distinct sets of historical thinking: lower-order (recall) and higher-order skills (analysis and 
argumentation). In addition, the question tested students’ mastery of the historical reasoning skills of 
Causation and Contextualization and the history disciplinary practice of Argument Development. Although the 
prompt did not explicitly target the historical thinking skill of Continuity and Change over Time, it offered 
students ample opportunities to address fundamental shifts in state-directed economic policy as motivated by 
such key events as the World Wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, the development of international 
capitalism/neoliberalism, and the rise and fall of communism and fascism, as well as more recent 
developments such as economic globalization and the development of international organizations and blocs. 
Although responses were mostly expected to address twentieth-century developments, the prompt’s wording 
allowed coverage of content from the period after 2000 as well. Responses could develop an argument by 
demonstrating knowledge of a wide variety of economic models and theories, including communist central 
planning, laissez-faire capitalism, Keynesian economics, corporatist economic approaches in fascist states, etc. 
The question also provided opportunities for (though it did not require) responses to engage in comparing the 
effects of various types of economic policies pursued by states since 1900. 

Sample: 4A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because the first paragraph presents a historically defensible 
claim and line of reasoning (the disruptions of World War I and the Great Depression caused “nations such as 
Germany, the U.S., and the Russians to implement state controlled economies,” as shown in the New Deal, 
Soviet collectivization and the economic policies of Germany’s “fascism state”). The response also earned        
1 point for Contextualization because the discussion (also in the first paragraph) about the impact of World 
War I and the Great Depression and the resultant weakening of nations “dependence on trade” within the 
global economy successfully describes a broader historical context relevant to the development of states and 
economic policy in the period after 1900. 

The response earned 2 points for evidence. There are multiple examples of specific historical evidence 
mentioned and, in most cases, clearly and explicitly used to support claims or arguments about the prompt 
throughout the essay. Examples include the discussion of such legislative acts as the AAA, TWA, PWA, NRA, 
and the Social Security Act; Lenin’s implementation of the New Economic Policy; Stalin’s use of collectivized 
farms; and the Sputnik program. Most of the evidence is effectively used in support of claims or arguments 
relevant to the prompt. Examples include the use of New Deal programs to support the claim that the United 
States used “Keysenian economics” to get out of the Great Depression or the statement that “the 
collectivization of farms under Stalin in the totalitarian regime further supports the government’s involvement 
in the economy after 1900.” Some of the evidence offered, notably the discussion (in the fourth paragraph) of 
Germany’s use of extreme nationalism and total war to “implement state control,” is not specific to states’ 
control of the economy and was not counted toward the earning of the evidence points. But the response 
contains plenty of other, on-topic evidence that earned credit.

2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning by explaining how some states’ control of their economies 
changed over time. This is evident in the second paragraph, where the essay offers a brief evaluation of the 
long-term impact of the United States New Deal up through the present day, stating that “[e]ven though the 
New Deal had its failures, the effects of the program on the banking system are still seen to this day. The 
control of the government in the U.S. can be seen as ‘too much’.” The use of the historical reasoning process of 
Continuity and Change Over Time is also evident in the conclusion: “The effect of the governments’ control 
over the economy is still in use today to a certain extent. One of the main themes taken away from the 
government’s involvement in the economy is that the person’s liberties are lessened during times of war and 
this is shown in the United States internment of Japanese citizens or the passage of the Alien and Sedition 
Acts. Additionally, the government controlled economies after World War 2 lead to the World Trade 
Organization and the International Monetary Fund which dramatically affect the economy of nations of today’s 
world.” 

The response earned 1 point for complexity due to the presence of nuanced arguments throughout, including 
complex arguments and multiple examples of supporting evidence to qualify its many claims. 

Sample: 4B 
Score: 5  

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because the statement (in the first paragraph) that “some 
countries such as the United States delt with [economic problems in the period after 1900] in reasonable laws 
and slight changes, [while] other countries completely changed their government and allowed the government 
to control more, such as the U.S.S.R.” establishes a historically defensible claim and a line of reasoning that is 
developed throughout the rest of the essay. The response also earned 1 point for contextualization. The first 
and second paragraphs contain a limited but sufficient amount of detail concerning the cause and events of the 
Great Depression (war debts, banks shutting down, citizens losing jobs, businesses losing profits) to 
contextualize the argument about the need for governments to assume economic control. 

The response earned 2 points for evidence for its multiple uses of specific evidence relevant to the extent of 
states control of their economy in the period after 1900, including the use of public service projects by the 
government of the United States and collectivization efforts in the USSR. The evidence is typically used in 
support of arguments or claims relevant to the prompt. For example, in the second paragraph, the fact that the 
United States abandoned the gold standard is explicitly used to support the argument that the “United States 
treasury” was seeking to “temporarily control the value of the US dollar.” Similarly, (in the third paragraph) the 
Soviet collectivization policies are used explicitly in support of the claim that, in the Soviet case, “the 
government has taken complete control of the country and stripped citizens of some basic rights.” Some of the 
evidence offered (for example, in the discussion of Soviet repressive policies against its own people in the third 
paragraph) is not directly relevant to state economic control and was not credited toward the earning of the 
evidence points.

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it repeatedly demonstrates successful use of 
Historical Reasoning processes (typically causation and continuity and change over time) to explain various 
aspects of states’ efforts to control their economies in the twentieth century. This is demonstrated especially 
clearly in the second paragraph, where the response offered a multilayered, causally connected chain of 
developments detailing both the cases and the effects of the United States government’s policies in response to 
the Great Depression. 

The response did not earn the point for complexity because, while it offers a solid thesis that is well supported 
with evidence, it does not develop that into a complex, multifactor argument showing awareness of nuance, 
contradiction, or historical complexity. 

Sample: 4C 
Score: 2 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim. The statement (in the first paragraph) that “[m]any states 
adopted policies to control or manage their economies. Some examples of this was the United States adopted 
capitalism and different countries like Germany and Russia adopted communism” provided a reductionist but 
nonetheless minimally acceptable historically defensible claim that is developed in the rest of the essay. The 
thesis statement’s line of reasoning, though not clearly stated, is taken to be that some economic systems are 
used to “control” while others merely to “manage” countries’ economies.  

The response also earned 1 point for contextualization. The contextual information is scattered through the 
essay, with some of it appearing near the top of page 2 (“After World War I we had the Great Depression which 
later turned into a global crisis”) and some of it appearing in the concluding paragraph (“economies in the 
1900s went through a crisis in the early 1940s [sic] due to the stock market crash and loss of jobs”). Despite 
being imprecise with details and not very accurate chronologically, this information is nonetheless deemed 
minimally sufficient to earn the point. 

The response did not earn either of the two evidence points. Virtually all the material presented as evidence is 
either too general (for example, the United States “using capitalism” or the Soviet Union being “one of the first 
to take communism and make it into what it is now”) or off-topic (does not address states economic policies). 
Examples include the discussion of the feminist movement, Cesar E. Chavez, JFK, and the Cuban Missile 
Crisis, etc. 

The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning because the dearth of relevant evidence and the 
generally political, rather than economic, tenor of the claims make it difficult to it discern any attempts to 
deploy historical reasoning relevant to the prompt. The response did not earn the point for complexity for the 
same reasons.
