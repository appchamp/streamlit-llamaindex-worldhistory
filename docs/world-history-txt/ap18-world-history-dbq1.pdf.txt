Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

Maximum Possible Points: 7 

“Evaluate the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in Afro-Eurasia between 1860 and 
1918.” 

Points  Rubric 

Responds to the prompt with a 
historically defensible thesis/claim 
that establishes a line of 
reasoning.  
(1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must 
make a claim that responds to the 
prompt rather than restating or 
rephrasing the prompt. The thesis 
must consist of one or more 
sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

Notes 
The thesis must take a position on the extent to which 
railroads affected the process of empire-building in Afro-
Eurasia between 1860 and 1918 and indicate some reason 
for taking that position. 

Examples: 
• 

“Although railroad construction in Asia and Africa 
greatly facilitated the development of European 
colonial empires, it also aided in the emergence of 
nationalist movements against European rule.” 
(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim 
that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads in Afro-Eurasia 
helped European imperialism because it allowed 
Europeans to increase their political power in Asia 
and Africa.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning) 

Describes a broader historical 
context relevant to the prompt.     
(1 point) 

To earn the point the response must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the role of railroads in the process of 
empire-building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries.   

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to 
broader historical events, 
developments, or processes that 
occur before, during, or continue 
after the time frame of the question. 
This point is not awarded for merely 
a phrase or reference. 

Examples:  
• 

“Railroads played an important role in the 
Industrial Revolution because they provided a 
faster and more efficient method of overland 
transport than had ever existed before. (relates 
broader events and developments to the topic) 
“Industrial Revolution technologies aided 
Europeans in the creation of large empires by 
linking places together at cheaper cost.” (relates 
broader events and developments to the topic)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence from the Documents: 
Uses the content of at least three 
documents to address the topic of 
the prompt. (1 point) 

To earn 1 point the response must accurately describe — 
rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of 
the documents to address the topic of railroads and 
imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries.  

OR

complains that Europeans in second-class 
carriages treat them poorly.” (Describes the 
document accurately, and thus is credited as 
addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie the 
description to an argument in response to the prompt) 

OR         

To earn 2 points the response must accurately describe — 
rather than simply quote — the content from at least six 
documents. In addition, the response must use the content 
from the documents to support an argument in response to 
the prompt.  

Example: 
• 

(Document 5): “The editorial to the News Chronicle 
in 1901 arguing for Britain and other European 
powers to protect their interests in Asia against the 
future Russian expansion that would follow the 
construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad 
illustrates that railroads facilitated the expansion of 
empires.” (Accurately describes and connects the 
content of the document to an argument about the 
effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-
Eurasia)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence beyond the Documents: 
Uses at least one additional piece of 
specific historical evidence (beyond 
that found in the documents) 
relevant to an argument about the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point the evidence must 
be described, and it must be more 
than a phrase or reference. This 
additional piece of evidence must be 
different from the evidence used to 
earn the point for contextualization. 

Sourcing: For at least three 
documents, explains how or why 
the document’s point of view, 
purpose, historical situation, and/or 
audience is relevant to an 
argument. (1 point) 

See document summaries for 
examples of possible sourcing.

Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, 
analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the 
documents. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be 
more general statements that place an argument or a 
significant portion of it on a broader context.  

Example: 
• 

“Like the European powers, Japan developed an 
extensive railway network in Korea to facilitate its 
imperial control.” (Provides a piece of evidence not 
in the documents relevant to an argument that 
addresses the prompt) 

To earn this point the response must explain — rather than 
simply identify — how or why the document’s point of view, 
purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an 
argument that addresses the prompt for each of the three 
documents sourced.  

Examples: 
• 

(Document 3): “Because the Ottoman sultan had to 
approve the proposals mentioned in Document 3, 
the report attempts to flatter the sultan by 
emphasizing his supposed popularity among 
Muslims across the world and how the 
construction of a railroad from Damascus to Mecca 
would only increase that popularity.” (Provides 
sourcing regarding the audience of the government 
report relevant to an argument addressing the 
prompt) 
(Document 5): “As a politician, Sir Henry Norman 
is critical of Britain ‘continuing to sleep’ in terms of 
responding to Russian imperial expansion in East 
Asia, and he is interested in persuading the British 
government and public opinion to adopt a different 
policy.” (Provides sourcing regarding the POV of the 
author relevant to an argument addressing the 
prompt)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Complexity: Demonstrates a 
complex understanding of the 
historical development that is the 
focus of prompt, using evidence to 
corroborate, qualify, or modify an 
argument that addresses the 
question. (1 point) 

This understanding must be part of 
the argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Examples of demonstrating a complex understanding for this 
question might include: 
•  Considering the totality of the evidence and 
perspectives presented in the documents as 
demonstrated by creating a complex argument, while 
at the same time recognizing that some documents 
corroborate, qualify or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 

multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an 
argument that explains how European railroad 
construction simultaneously strengthened colonial 
authority in Africa and Asia while also contributing to 
growing tensions with indigenous communities and 
eventually leading to the development of nationalist 
movements 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how railroads and 
other new types of communication were used to 
strengthen nation states in the nineteenth century (e.g., 
European states, United States, Meiji Japan) or in 
premodern times (e.g., the Roman road networks or the 
Mongol postal system.)

Document Summaries and Possible Sourcing  

Document  

Summary of Content 

1. British-Indian 
Association 
petition to the 
British colonial 
government 
(1866) 

•  Claims that high-caste 

Hindus are subject to abuse 
from European passengers on 
second-class carriages and 
are forced to interact with the 
masses outside the train 
platforms. Women’s 
respectability is also 
jeopardized. 

2. Qing dynasty 
official 
memorandum to 
the court (1867) 

•  Argues that the Qing 

government should build 
railroads but should not do so 
by giving concessions to 
Western companies, unless 
they meet very stringent 
criteria. 

3. Ottoman 
government 
report (1893) 

•  Argues that the construction 
of a railroad from Damascus 
to Mecca would aid Muslims 
in traveling to the holy cities 
of Mecca and Medina and 
would increase the prestige 
of the Ottoman sultan in the 
Muslim world. It would also 
decrease reliance on 
foreign/Western ships. 

Explains the relevance of point of view, 
purpose, situation, and/or audience by 
elaborating on examples such as: 
Imposition of direct British rule 
• 
following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 
(situation) 

•  High-caste Hindus complaining about 
the lack of traditional deference shown 
to them because of their social status. 
(POV) 

•  Since the purpose is to get the 

government to act, the petition uses 
hyperbole (the analogy to the Middle 
Passage). 

•  Memorial written in the context of the 
Self-Strengthening movement and 
following the Taiping Rebellion. 
(situation) 

•  The official wants to modernize China 

without antagonizing the rural 
population. (purpose) 

•  May infer that the official advocates 
setting a very high bar for giving 
Westerners permission to build 
railways because he is in favor of the 
Chinese building the railways. 
(purpose) 

•  Report written during a period when 
the Ottoman Empire considered the 
extent of reforms needed to address 
growing Western political and 
economic dominance. (situation) 
•  Report intended to convince the sultan 
to construct a railroad and flatter him. 
(purpose/audience)

railway advocated by the 
imperialist Cecil Rhodes to 
connect Cairo to the South 
African port of Cape Town 

•  Published during period of European 

• 

colonial expansion in Africa (situation) 
Intended for British officials and 
settlers in New Zealand; highlighting a 
grand imperial project elsewhere in the 
British Empire to instill pride in British 
imperial achievements

a British 
politician in a 
British 
newspaper about 
the construction 
of the Trans-
Siberian

French West 
Africa to colonial 
administrative 
council (1904)

officer, magazine 
article published 
in London (1913) 

•  Argues that the construction 

of the Trans-Siberian 
Railroad will allow Russia to 
dominate East Asia unless 
the other European powers 
protect their interests there 

• 

•  Great Game between Russia and 
Britain in Central Asia (situation) 
Intended to influence public and 
government opinion by criticizing 
British inaction on the issue 
(purpose/audience) 

•  Argues that the construction 

• 

of railroads in French 
territory in West Africa is not 
only necessary for economic 
reasons but also to lift Africa 
out of “poverty and 
barbarism” 

•  Argues that the construction 
of railways in India is helping 
to unify the numerous ethnic 
and religious groups of India 
into a more cohesive political 
and cultural community loyal 
to Great Britain  

Influence of ideas of European cultural 
superiority and “civilizing mission vis-
a-vis its imperial subjects and 
territories (situation) 

•  Attempting to convince colonial 

administrative council to approve the 
construction of railroads, which would 
be in Roume’s best interests as 
governor (purpose) 

•  British army officer intending to 

maintain British rule in India as Indian 
nationalist movements continue to

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student 

could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of this rubric require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not 
detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is 
accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples (when available) are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in 
Afro-Eurasia in the period 1860–1918 and indicate some reason for taking that position. 

Examples of acceptable theses: 

• 

• 

• 

“Although railroad construction in Asia and African greatly facilitated the development of European 
colonial empires, it also aided in the emergence of nationalist movements against European rule.” 
(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads had a limited impact on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia because the 
development of advanced military weaponry and European control over maritime trade were more 
significant.” (responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads in Afro-Eurasia helped European imperialism because it allowed 
Europeans to increase their political power in Asia and Africa.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 

Example of unacceptable theses:  

• 

• 

“The construction of railroads greatly affected European imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries.” (Merely repeats the wording of the prompt with a minor qualification, which does 
not amount to indicating a line of reasoning) 
“Railroads came to Asia and Africa too late to save the European colonial empires there from 
collapsing.” (Not a historically defensible claim)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

“Railroad construction in Afro-Eurasia influenced the development of European empires in Asia and Africa and 
the development of the Qing and Ottoman empires.” (While it provides a few concrete examples of empires, the 
sentence does not respond to the prompt directly, nor does it establish a line of reasoning.) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn a point for contextualization by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. 
To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. 

To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to railroads in the process of empire-
building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  

Examples of acceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“Railroads played an important role in the Industrial Revolution because they provided a faster and 
more efficient method of overland transport than had ever existed before. (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic) 
“Industrial Revolution technologies aided Europeans in the creation of large empires by linking places 
together at cheaper cost.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“Railroads were a part of the Industrial Revolution.” (Potentially relevant, but neither “describes” how 
railroads were part of that context, nor offers language that could plausibly be interpreted as relevant to 
empire.) 
“European powers held a series of conferences in the late nineteenth century to defuse tensions 
between them and avert war.” (While the broader historical events described are potentially connected to 
empire, the response offers no language that could plausibly be interpreted as relevant to railroads.) 

C. Evidence (0–3 points) 

a) Document Content — Addressing the Topic (1 point) 

In order to achieve the first point, the response must use the content of at least three documents to address the 
topic of the prompt (1 point). To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately 
describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of 
railroads and imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  

Example of describing the content of a document:  

• 

(Document 1): “In its petition to the British colonial government, the British-Indian Association 
complains that Europeans in second-class carriages treat them poorly.” (Describes the document 
accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie the description to an 
argument in response to the prompt)

2018 SCORING GUIDELINES 

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

b) Document Content — Supporting an Argument (1 point) 

In order to achieve the second point for evidence from the documents, the response needs to support an 
argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least six documents (2 points).  

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 

• 

• 

(Document 2): “By explaining how the construction of railroads could simultaneously strengthen the 
Qing Empire economically and yet could also weaken it if Western powers were allowed to build 
railroads without considering the effects on China’s rural population, the memorandum to the Qing 
court demonstrates that railroads could have a tremendous impact on the development and survival of 
empires in Afro-Eurasia.” (Connects the contents of the document to an argument about the effects of 
railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia) 
(Document 4): “The editorial to the News Chronicle in 1901 arguing for Britain and other European 
powers to protect their interests in Asia against the future Russian expansion that would follow the 
construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad illustrates that railroads not only facilitated the expansion 
of empires, but could also threaten them by generating tensions with other states.” (Connects the 
content of the document to an argument about the effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia) 

c) Evidence beyond the Documents (1 point) 

The response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the 
documents) relevant to an argument that addresses the effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia 
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1 point). To earn this point the evidence must be described, and it 
must be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence 
used to earn the point for contextualization.  

Typically statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn 
from the documents. 

Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond the documents 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt:  

• 

• 

“Like the European powers, Japan developed an extensive railway network in Korea to facilitate its 
imperial control.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in the documents relevant to an argument that 
addresses the prompt) 
“Western transnational companies advocated for the creation of railroads in Latin America because it 
suited their economic interests, much as they did in Afro-Eurasia.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in 
the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (2 points) 

Document Sourcing (0–1 point) 

For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, 
historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt (1 point). To earn 
this point the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of 
view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of 
the three documents sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view:  

• 

(Document 5): “As a politician, Sir Henry Norman is critical of Britain ‘continuing to sleep’ in terms of 
responding to Russian imperial expansion in East Asia, and he is interested in persuading the British 
government and public opinion to adopt a different policy.” (Provides sourcing regarding the POV of the 
author relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 

• 

(Document 2): “By cautioning the Qing court against allowing Western investors to build railroads in 
China, while supporting the building of new transportation and communication infrastructure in 
general, Shen Baozhen is trying to convince the Qing government to modernize China using the 
country’s own resources, a position shared by many Qing officials at the time.” (Provides sourcing 
regarding the purpose of the memorandum relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: 

• 

(Document 6): “Ernest Roume’s speech to the colonial assembly illustrates how Europeans justified 
their imperialism in Africa by claiming that what they were doing was bringing ‘progress’ and 
‘civilization’ to a land mired in ‘poverty’ and ‘barbarism.’” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical 
situation of the document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: 

• 

(Document 3): “Because the Ottoman sultan had to approve the proposals mentioned in Document 3, 
the report attempts to flatter the sultan by emphasizing his supposed popularity among Muslims across 
the world and how the construction of a railroad from Damascus to Mecca would only increase that 
popularity.” (Provides sourcing regarding the audience of the government report relevant to an argument 
addressing the prompt) 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding (0–1 point) 

The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the effects of railroads on empire-building in the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the question.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Considering the totality of the evidence and perspectives presented in the documents as demonstrated 
by creating a complex argument, while at the same time recognizing that some documents corroborate 
or qualify or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that explains how European railroad 
construction simultaneously strengthened colonial authority in Africa and Asia while also contributing 
to growing tensions with indigenous communities and eventually leading to the development of

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining how 
railroads and other new types of communication were used to strengthen nation states in the 
nineteenth century (e.g., European states, United States, Meiji Japan) or in premodern times (e.g., the

Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
historical documents. This DBQ asked students to evaluate the extent to which railroads affected the process of 
empire-building in Afro-Eurasia between 1860 and 1918. The question addressed Key Concepts 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 6.1, 
and 6.2 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework, with a particular focus on the topics of imperialism and 
nationalism, technologies associated with industrialization and their political effects, and international political 
and economic rivalries in the late nineteenth century. The question primarily addressed the historical reasoning 
skills of Causation and Contextualization and the disciplinary practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence (primary 
sources) and Argument Development. The seven documents provided students with opportunities to examine the 
effects of railroads on empire-building from a wide variety of angles and frames of historical inquiry (political 
history, economic history, social history). The documents were written from multiple perspectives, including 
those of overseas European empires (British and French), an expanding overland empire (Russia), and Asian 
empires (Qing China and the Ottoman Empire) seeking to use railroads in their own modernization programs and 
to forestall European encroachment. The documents also provided perspectives of both colonizers and colonial 
subjects and addressed major interimperial rivalries, such as the Scramble for Africa and the Great Game. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it claims that railroads served the empire-building project 
by transporting people (including soldiers) and ideologies like racism or nationalism.  

The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the second paragraph because it describes a broader 
historical context of navigational, industrial, and transport technology relevant to the role of railroads in the 
process of empire-building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence from the documents because all seven documents are used to 
support an argument in response to the prompt. The response earned 1 point for using evidence beyond the 
documents because it discusses the use of railroads and the spread of British culture and empire in the specific 
instance of the British Raj.  

The response earned 1 point for document sourcing because it explains for documents 1, 6, 2, 3, 7, and 5 how the 
documents’ purpose, audience, point of view, or historical situation is relevant to the argument. The response 
discusses the historical situation of these documents by linking them to background developments like social 
Darwinism, the Berlin Conference, Japanese industrialization, diminishing Ottoman influence, South Asian 
decentralized traditions, and English/Russian rivalry. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding because although it introduces 
some limited nuance in sourcing discussion for individual documents, the complexity of the argument as a whole 
is insufficient. The central claim about railroads helping to strengthen the empire is a fairly simple argument. It is 
certainly plausible, but nonetheless lacking the complex qualification or interrelated corroboration that

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

characterizes the more complex responses to this prompt. Furthermore, the abrupt and occasionally absent 
transitions between documents and ideas detract from the response’s ability to present a coherent and complex 
argument. 

Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 3 
Analysis and Reasoning: 1 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 4 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it claims that railroads promoted greater centralized control 
of movement in the empire. 

The response earned 1 point for contextualization because it describes a broader historical context of 
transportation technology and European expansion relevant to the role of railroads in the process of 
empire- building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  

The response earned 2 points for using evidence from the documents because, although document 7 is absent 
from the essay, the remaining six documents are used to support an argument in response to the prompt. The 
response did not earn the point for using evidence beyond the documents because the nondocument discussion 
in this essay is quite limited and mostly lacking in specific historical evidence; the tangential reference to the 
Middle Passage is only loosely connected to the topic of the essay. 

The response did not earn the point for document sourcing because although it analyzes the sourcing of 
document 4 and attempts to analyze the sourcing of document 6, it does not meet the required three-document 
threshold for this point. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding because the mechanical links 
between documentary evidence and the thesis of the essay only demonstrate a straightforward, competent 
argumentation lacking in nuance. 

Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it claims in the introduction that railroads benefited 
empire- building by promoting interregional interaction, creating jobs, and providing transportation. 

The response did not earn the point for contextualization because it is not attempted. 

The response earned 1 point for using evidence from the documents because, although the contents of 
documents 2, 3, 6, and 7 are used to address the topic, only documents 4 and 7 are used to support an argument
