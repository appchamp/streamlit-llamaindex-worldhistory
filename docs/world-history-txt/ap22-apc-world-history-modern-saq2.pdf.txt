3  points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists.

Short Answer Question 2 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to analyze a map that represented a plan of “Factories” in 
the city of Canton, Southern China, from 1856. In part A students were asked to identify one economic 
development in the period 1750–1900 that led to the “situation” or the factory system in Canton as 
represented by the map. Part B required students to identify one political development in the period 
1750–1900 that led to the same “situation.” Finally, part C asked for explanation as to why the survey 
of the factories was carried out by the British Royal Navy. 

Sample: 2A 
Score:  3  

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the relationship between the Treaty of Nanjing and 
British access to Chinese trade on their own terms. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying how the Opium Wars allowed Britain to trade freely 
with China, even though the Chinese did not want the trade. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining that British military victories empowered the Royal 
Navy and that because force was necessary to open trade, it was necessary to maintain it. 

Sample: 2B 
Score:  2  

a) The response did not earn the point because the connection between the Industrial Revolution and 
China trade is inaccurate for the period reflected in the prompt. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying how the Opium Wars led to European powers dividing 
up China into spheres of influence and connecting that to the construction of warehouses and trading 
posts. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining the British dominance over other European states and 
their desire to control less-developed economies. 

Sample: 2C 
Score:  1  

a) The response did not earn the point because it merely makes passing references to “trading posts” 
and “joint stock companies” but does not identify an economic development related to China. 

b) The response did not earn the point because the reference to “foreign exchange” is too vague and 
does not identify a political development related to the prompt. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining that the British Royal Navy “had control over that land 
and made it possible to expand their trade” as a reason for their carrying out the survey.
