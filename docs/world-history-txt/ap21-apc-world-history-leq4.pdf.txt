Question 4: Long Essay Question, Economic Responses to the Great Depression 

6  points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the twentieth century, governments responded to economic crises in various ways. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which governments (other than the United States government) changed their economic policies in 
response to the Great Depression.

Thesis/Claim  

(0–1 points)  

0 points  
Does not meet the criteria for one point.  

1 point  
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.  

Scoring Criteria  

Responses that  do not earn this  point:  
•  Are  not  historically defensible.  
•  Only restate or rephrase the prompt. 
•  Do not respond  to the  prompt. 
•  Do not establish a line of  reasoning.  
•  Are overgeneralized. 

Decision  Rules and  Scoring Notes  

Responses that  earn this point:  
•  Provide a historically defensible  thesis or claim about the extent  to which 

governments  (other than the United States government) changed their economic 
policies in response to the Great Depression, with some indication of the reasoning for 
making that claim. 

Note: The thesis does not  need to mention two separate nations.  

Examples that do not  earn this  point:  

Examples that earn this  point:  

Do not focus on the topic  of the  prompt  
• 

“The  economic crisis of the Great  Depression facilitated the rise 
of fascist  regimes such as Hitler’s Nazi Germany.” 

Provide a historically defensible  claim, but  do not establish a line  
of reasoning   
• 

“Stock market speculation was  one of the main causes of the 
Great Depression.” 

Provide a claim  that is not historically defensible  
• 

“Governments across the world joined in the Bretton Woods 
Conference to create the IMF and the World Bank in response 
to the Great Depression.” 

Establish a line  of  reasoning that evaluates the topic  of the  prompt  
• 

“Although many governments in the West made some changes to their economic 
policies by introducing socialist  measures, most  continued to  rely on free-market policies 
to guide economic development.” 

Establish a line  of reasoning that evaluates the topic  of the  prompt with analytic  
categories  
• 

“In many parts of Asia and Africa, governments only made minimal economic changes 
in response to the Great Depression because European colonial authorities were 
unwilling to introduce costly social welfare programs or implement policies that could 
reduce the profits of their companies.” 

Establish a line  of reasoning  
• 

“Governments across the world responded to the Great Depression by making their 
economies more  socialist.”   (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim) 

Additional Notes:  
•  The thesis or claim must consist  of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the 

first or last paragraphs.) 

•  The thesis or claim must identify  a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

relevant to the topic  of prompt. 
•  Provide evidence that is outside the 
time period or region specified in

• 

“After the Second World War 
communism spread rapidly  across 
Eastern Europe in regions occupied 
by the Soviet Union.” 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
• 

Identify at least  two specific historical examples  relevant 
to  government responses to the  Great Depression. 

Examples  of evidence that are  specific and relevant include  
the following (two examples required):  
•  The crash of the  Dow Jones in 1929 
•  High levels of unemployment across Europe  
•
  Severe declines in gross domestic product (up to  40% 

decline) in many world regions 

•  Restrictive trade policies imposed by governments 

around the world, such as the imposition of tariffs on 
imports by Great Britain 

Example of a statement that  earns 1 point for  evidence:  
• 

“In Germany  gross domestic product declined 
dramatically  during the early 1930s,  and the  government 
increased its import  tariffs.” 

• 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
 • Use at least two specific historical examples  to 

support an argument  regarding  how  governments 
changed their economic policies in response to the 
Great Depression. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with  
evidence:   
• 

“The severity of economic decline in Germany during 
the Great Depression was greater than in many 
other countries  because Germany was still under 
obligation to pay war reparations and relied on 
foreign investment. As a result of  widespread 
unemployment and poverty, the new Nazi 
government in Germany embarked on a new policy 
of economic self-sufficiency (autarky).” (Uses 
multiple, specific pieces of evidence to support the 
argument that the German government changed its 
economic policies as a result of the Great 
Depression) 
“Great Britain’s  economy stagnated during much of 
the 1920s. Labor unrest and strikes raised fears of 
class conflict and political instability.  The 
government policies of protectionism and 
abandoning the gold standard were only partially 
effective in addressing the crisis.” (Uses multiple, 
specific pieces of evidence to support the argument 
that the  British government changed its economic 
policies as a result of the Great  Depression)  

Additional Notes:  
•  Typically, statements credited as  evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument,  then it can meet the threshold of two  pieces of evidence  by  giving one  example for one part  of the argument and 
another example for a different  part of the argument,  but the total number of examples  must still be at least two. 
(For example, most governments in Asia  and Latin America  did not change their economic policies much  because  they were  either under  colonial rule, 
dominated by European or American companies,  or they did not  have the resources to  provide significant government assistance; governments in  Western 
Europe changed  their economic  policies significantly by imposing greater regulations on the financial sector, sponsoring large public works projects, and 
creating welfare programs.)

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that  do not

•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning 
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument.  

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
do not use it to frame 
or structure an 
argument. 

Examples  that do not earn

Provide  evidence but offer  
no reasoning to connect  
the evidence  to an 
argument  
• 

“Unemployment 
increased significantly 
during the Great 
Depression.” 

Responses  that earn 1  point:  
•  Must  demonstrate the use of historical  reasoning to  
explain  how  governments changed their economic 
policies in response to the Great Depression.  

Using  a  historical thinking skill to frame or structure an  
argument could  include:  
•  Explaining  why the Great Depression led many 

governments to  enact or expand  their social welfare 
programs. 

•  Explaining how  changes in government economic 
policies in response to the Great  Depression 
changed the global economy in the 1930s.  
•  Comparing how the Great Depression led to 

different or similar policy responses by different 
governments. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning:  
•  “Some countries responded to the Great Depression 
by embracing nationalism, fascism, and militarism, 
such as  in Germany and Japan.  Germany expanded 
its military and pursued  economic self-sufficiency.” 
(Compares responses to the Great Depression 
enacted by several different  governments  and 
connects the reaction to a change) 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as:  
•  Explaining  the  nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects.  

•  Explaining relevant and insightful con en ctions within and across 

pe ir ods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes.  

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating  complex understanding might include any of the  
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:  
•  Explaining  the nuance of an issue by arguing that  many governments 
adopted social welfare programs in response to  the Great Depression 
but tailored them to fit within an overall free-market economic 
system.  For example, a response could discuss the welfare policies 
pursued by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, which were aimed at 
limiting or abolishing the strength of independent labor unions, while 
pursuing key  goals of the Fascist and Nazi regimes such as  encouraging 
pro-natalist social policies. (Explains nuance, considers both causes 
and effects, and  qualifies an argument)  

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as explaining how the experiences of the Great Depression 
encouraged  governments to pursue new economic policies in the 
aftermath of the Depression. For  example,  a response could argue 
that the partial success of Keynesian economic policies to address  the 
effects of the Great Depression led Western European governments 
(for example,  the British Labor government) to be more open to  the 
idea of directing economic growth through planning, nationalization 
of some industries, and expanding the welfare  state in the aftermath 
of the Second World War.  (Explains relevant and insightful 
connections)

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating  that the responses of many 
governments to  the Great Depression evolved over time, for example 
in Great Britain the government initially adopted measures to raise 
taxes, hold down wages, and support the Gold Standard  before 
switching course and adopting a more active role in promoting 
employment and wage stabilization measures  as  well as deficit 
spending.  (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument  by demonstrating how  governments’ 
responses to the Great Depression co-evolved with changing 
economic theories, such as the transition from free-market laissez-
faire philosophy to Keynesian  economics. (Corroborates an argument, 
considers both causes and effects)  

Additional Notes:  
• 

This demonstration of complex understanding  must be part of the  argument, not merely a phrase  or reference.

Question 4  — Long Essay Question  

Note: Student  samples  are quoted  verbatim  and  may  contain spelling  and  grammatical  errors.  

Overview 

This question addressed Topic 7.4: Economy in the Interwar Period and Topic 7.6: Causes of World War II of 
the AP World History Curriculum and Framework. The question was open geographically to allow responses 
from any nation outside of the United States, though the vast majority of responses focused on developments 
in Germany and Russia. The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of 
the Great Depression and its global impacts, with the specific exclusion of the United States helping to focus 
responses on global issues. With the close proximity to the First World War and the Second World War, two 
topics about which students tend to have extensive knowledge, the question provided opportunities for ample 
content and context. Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical 
context relevant to the prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt, use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to 
frame or structure their argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development 
that is the focus of the prompt. Students were able to use any historical thinking skill to demonstrate this 
understanding, and we saw successful responses that compared the impact of the Great Depression on two 
areas (most commonly a comparison of Russia and Germany), discussed how specific elements of the Great 
Depression (such as inflation) led to specific government responses, or responses that addressed how 
government responses changed as the twentieth century progressed. 

Sample: 4A  
Thesis: 1  
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2  
Analysis and  Reasoning: 2  

Total Score: 6 

 A. Thesis/Claim  (0−1  points):  1 
The response earned the point for the last two sentences of the introductory paragraph, where it states that 
some governments “changed their economic policies in response to the Great Depression by finding 
interesting ways to increase employment rates,” while other governments’ “economic policies were not 
altered.” 

 B. Contextualization  (0−1  points):  1 
The response earned the point in the introductory paragraph for discussing “the inability of numerous 
countries to pay off their debts, which accumulated as a result of World War I.” 

 C. Evidence  (0−2  points):  2  
The response earned 1 point for identifying Hitler’s “violation of the Versailles Treaty” and his “weapons 
production.” The response also provides numerous additional pieces of relevant evidence throughout. 

The response earned the second evidence point by using Hitler’s violation of the Treaty of Versailles and 
increase in weapons production to support an argument that Hitler’s economic policies in response to the 
Depression led to the creation of new jobs. The factually accurate discussion of Russia’s continuation of the 
Five-Year Plans also provides examples of evidence being used to support an argument.

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and  Reasoning  (0−2  points):  2  
The response earned the point for historical reasoning by structuring a solid causation argument in the case of 
Germany’s response to the Great Depression. In addition, the response provides a comparison of the response 
in Germany to a lack of a response in Russia. 

The response earned the point for demonstrating complex understanding through its nuanced analysis of the 
lack of an international response to German militarism in the context of the recovery after the First World 
War. In addition, the response provides additional analysis of a government response in its discussion of 
Russia’s economic policies being a reaction to Lenin’s NEP and not necessarily to the Great Depression. 

Sample:  4B  
Thesis: 0  
Contextualization:  1  
Evidence: 2  
Analysis and  Reasoning: 0  

Total Score: 3 

 A. Thesis/Claim  (0−1  points):  0 
The response attempts a thesis in the first paragraph but did not earn the point, as it does not move past a 
rephrasing of the prompt. No specific economic policy is identified. 

 B. Contextualization  (0−1  points):  1 
The response earned the point at the beginning of the second paragraph with its discussion of the Treaty of 
Versailles’ impact on the German economy. The response continues by identifying hyperinflation and the loss 
of colonies as additional elements that negatively impacted Germany. 

C.  Evidence  (0−2  points):  2  
The response earned 1 point in the third paragraph, where it states that “[a] fascist government was put in 
charge” and in the fourth paragraph by where it states that “[t]he Nazis lowered the unemployment rates of 
Germany by creating fine paying jobs.” There are additional pieces of evidence regarding Nazi economic 
policies further into the response. 

The response earned the second evidence point in the third and fourth paragraphs, by using the evidence 
provided to support claims that the German Nazi government “allowed for economic help and assistance to the 
struggling nation” and that “[w]here as government assistance and interference on the economic side was not 
used widely before, the Nazis were known for doing so.” 

D. Analysis and  Reasoning  (0−2  points):  0  
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning because its arguments are one-dimensional and 
focused exclusively on German responses to the Depression. While addressing more than one country is not 
necessary for answering the question, many of the usual pathways to earning the historical reasoning point 
include comparing different governments’ responses or addressing global impacts of the economic changes 
brought about by the Great Depression. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a complex understanding, as it does not offer a complex 
or nuanced analysis or make insightful connections to other periods or historical contexts.

The response did not earn the point for using evidence as it provides only one piece of evidence (regarding 
German hyperinflation). No second piece of evidence is provided. 

The response did not earn the second evidence point as only one piece of evidence is used in support of an 
argument. 

D. Analysis and  Reasoning  (0−2  points):  0  
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning, as it only provides a description of the Great 
Depression in Germany and not an analysis of a German government response to the Great Depression. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating complex understanding as it does not demonstrate a 
complex or nuanced understanding or provide insightful connections to other periods or historical contexts.
