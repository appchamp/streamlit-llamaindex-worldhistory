Notes 
The thesis must take a position on the extent to which 
the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century and indicate some 
reason for taking that position. 

Examples: 

• 

• 

“Although the arrival of the Portuguese was a 
very important change in Indian Ocean maritime 
trade in the sixteenth century, it did not 
completely transform the trade, as the Portuguese 
never extended their control beyond a few ports 
and had to compete with Indian merchants and 
regional states such as the Ottoman Empire and 
the Sultanate of Aceh.” (Responds to the prompt 
with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 
“The Portuguese transformed maritime trade in 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century by taxing 
non-Portuguese ships that traded in the region.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally 
acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to Portuguese impact and/or maritime 
trade in the Indian Ocean in the period before or during 
the arrival of the Portuguese.  

Note: The context has to be relevant to maritime trade in 
the Indian Ocean. 

Examples: 

• 

• 

“For centuries before the arrival of European 
merchants, the Indian Ocean had been the center 
of flourishing trade routes connecting India to 
East and Southeast Asia as well as with East 
Africa, Egypt, and Arabia.” (Relates broader events 
and developments to the topic.) 
“Portugal’s naval advances such as stronger 
ships allowed the Portuguese to engage in 
transoceanic trade. (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence from the Documents: 
Uses the content of at least three 
documents to address the topic of the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn 1 point, the response must accurately describe —
rather than simply quote — the content from at least three 
of the documents to address the topic of how the 
Portuguese affected maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in 
the sixteenth century. 

OR         

Example: 

Supports an argument in response to 
the prompt using at least six 
documents. (2 points) 

• 

 (Document 3): “The anonymous Portuguese court 
official is arguing that Portugal should do all it 
can to prevent Turkish merchants from 
establishing direct trade between India and the 
Ottoman Empire.” (Describes the document 
accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the 
topic, but does not explicitly tie the description to an 
argument in response to the prompt.) 

OR     

To earn 2 points, the response must accurately describe 
—rather than simply quote — the content from at least six 
documents. In addition, the response must use the content 
from the documents to support an argument in response to 
the prompt.  

Example: 

• 

(Document 6): “The Venetian trader Cesare 
Federici’s account shows how in Cambay the 
Portuguese are almost completely dependent on 
their Hindu brokers to carry out their trade, 
showing that the Portuguese adapted to existing 
Indian Ocean trade.” (Accurately describes and 
connects the content of the document to an 
argument about how the Portuguese transformed 
maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth 
century.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence beyond the Documents: 
Uses at least one additional piece of 
specific historical evidence (beyond that 
found in the documents) relevant to an 
argument about the prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the evidence must be 
described, and must be more than a 
phrase or reference. This additional piece 
of evidence must be different from the 
evidence used to earn the point for 
contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as evidence from outside 
the documents will be more specific details relevant to an 
argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn 
from the documents. Typically, statements credited as 
contextualization will be more general statements that 
place an argument or a significant portion of it on a 
broader context.  

Note: The specific outside evidence must be clearly 
relevant to the expansion of, or limits to, Portuguese 
influence in the Indian Ocean. 

Examples could include the following, with appropriate 
elaboration: 

•  Portuguese advances in navigational technology, 
such as the development of caravels and carracks 

•  Ottoman–Christian wars and rivalries in the 
Mediterranean, such as the battle of Lepanto 

•  Safavid empire as another regional power 

checking the expansion of Portugal in the Indian 
Ocean 

•  Political fragmentation of India as Delhi 

sultanates fail 

Sourcing: For at least three documents, 
explains how or why the document’s 
point of view, purpose, historical 
situation, and/or audience is relevant to 
an argument. (1 point) 

To earn this point, the response must explain — rather 
than simply identify — how or why the document’s point 
of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for 
each of the three documents sourced.  

See document summaries for examples 
of possible sourcing.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the question. (1 point) 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Examples of demonstrating a complex understanding for 
this question might include: 

•  Considering the totality of the evidence and 
perspectives presented in the documents as 
demonstrated by creating a complex argument, 
while at the same time recognizing that some 
documents corroborate, qualify, or modify the 
overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple factors or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument that explains how the 
Portuguese both disrupted existing trade patterns 
and connections in the Indian Ocean, but also 
provided Indian merchants and manufacturers 
with new business opportunities, such as new 
trading partnerships and new export markets 
•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections 
across time and space, such as explaining 
similarities or differences in the pattern of 
sixteenth-century Portuguese imperialism in the 
Indian Ocean compared to patterns in other 
locations such as Brazil, West Africa, Japan, 
China, or the spice islands of Southeast Asia

Document Summaries and Possible Sourcing 

Document  

Summary of Content 

1. Muslim 
merchants 
advice to the 
ruler of Calicut, 
(1500) 

•  Expresses Muslim merchants’ 
opposition to the Hindu ruler 
of Calicut welcoming the 
Portuguese and warns the 
ruler to be cautious 

2. Duarte 
Barbosa, 
account of 
Calicut (1516) 

•  Describes past wealth and 
independence of Muslim 
merchants in Calicut but 
states that most of the 
Muslim merchants have left  

Explains the relevance of point of view, 
purpose, situation, and/or audience by 
elaborating on examples such as: 
•  Written 50 years after the events, 

Portugal has consolidated its presence 
in the region and the Portuguese 
historian is recording the spread of 
Portuguese power (situation). 
•  Written by Muslim merchants 

concerned that the Portuguese will 
become their political and economic 
rivals (POV). 

•  Portuguese government official on the 
Malabar coast likely would have 
wanted to emphasize positive effects 
of the Portuguese establishing trading 
posts (POV/purpose). 

•  Written in the very early years of the 

Portuguese establishing a presence in 
India, the account seeks to emphasize 
the Portuguese achievement of already 
displacing the Muslims (situation). 

3. Anonymous 
Portuguese court 
official’s advice 
to King 
Sebastian (mid-
1560s) 

4. Sultan 
Alauddin of 
Aceh, letter to 
the Ottoman 
sultan (1566)  

•  Cautions king against free 

•  The Ottoman Empire’s westward 

trade treaty with the Ottoman 
Empire due to competition 
from Ottoman merchants  

expansion has brought it into conflict 
with several Western European 
countries, including Portugal, over 
control of Mediterranean and Indian 
Ocean trade (situation). 

•  As private advice offered to the king of 
Portugal by a high-level government 
official, the letter offers a frank 
analysis of the dangers Ottomans pose 
to Portugal’s spice monopoly and the 
many advantages Ottoman merchants 
would enjoy if allowed to compete 
freely (audience/purpose). 

•  Describes Portuguese threat 
to Acehnese pilgrims and 
merchants and requests 
Ottoman help in defense 

•  An address to a fellow Muslim ruler; 
uses Islamic rhetoric and appeals to 
shared Muslim values (audience). 
•  The Ottoman Empire’s success in 

fighting against European powers has 
boosted its military prestige and other 
Muslim rulers are asking the Ottomans 
for military assistance (situation).

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

5. Zainudeen Al 
Sageer, address 
to southern 
Indian Muslims 
(circa 1570) 

•  Describes Portuguese system 
of safe conduct passes, 
opposing it but also noting it 
has been accepted by Calicut 
merchants 

•  A religious scholar, perhaps wishing 
to emphasize the negative aspects of 
the arrival of the Portuguese on 
maritime commerce in Calicut (POV) 

•  Describes successful Portuguese 

6. Cesare 
Federici, The 
Voyage and 
Travel to East 
India (1587) 

•  Describes local-agent broker 
system for trade in Cambay, 
as well as the low-price and 
low-quality pepper exchange 
at Cochin 

7. Inlaid box 
made in Gujarat 
for export to 
Portugal (circa 
1600) 

•  Shows a box inlaid with ivory 
and precious hardwoods, 
decorated with a hunting 
scene 

efforts to implement the safe passage 
pass (cartaz) in South Asia (situation) 

•  As Venetians were generally rivals of 
the Portuguese in trade, Federici may 
have intended this account to point to 
the limitations of the commercial 
power and reach of the Portuguese in 
India (POV/purpose). 

•  As Federici’s account was published in 

Venice and likely intended for a 
Venetian merchant audience, it may 
have emphasized the potential 
commercial opportunities in India
for 
example, by suggesting that only low-
, 
quality pepper is being sold to the 
Portuguese, while the high-quality 
pepper remains available for purchase 
in India (audience). 

•  As an object made specifically for 

export to Portugal, the box illustrates 
how important Portuguese (and 
therefore European) markets had 
become to some Indian craftspeople 
(situation).  

•  As a precious and likely very 

expensive object, the box shows the 
increased luxury goods consumption 
of European elites, who had enough 
economic resources not only to buy 
such items but also to influence to 
their design and artistic style 
(audience).

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student 

could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of this rubric require that students demonstrate historically defensible 

content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not detract 
from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Student samples (when available) are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0-1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian 
Ocean in the sixteenth century and indicate some reason for taking that position. 

Examples of acceptable theses: 

• 

• 

• 

“Although the arrival of the Portuguese was a very important change in Indian Ocean maritime trade in 
the sixteenth century, it did not completely transform the trade, as the Portuguese never extended their 
control beyond a few ports and had to compete with Indian merchants and regional states such as the 
Ottoman Empire and the Sultanate of Aceh.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that 
establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“The Portuguese brought a few changes to the Indian Ocean trading networks but most Indian goods, 
including spices, continued to be traded locally, or to Middle Eastern and Chinese markets, as they had 
been for centuries before.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 
“The Portuguese transformed maritime trade in Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century by taxing non-
Portuguese ships that traded in the region.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim 
that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Example of unacceptable theses:  

• 

• 

• 

“In the sixteenth century, the arrival of the Portuguese completely transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean region.” (Merely repeats the wording of the prompt with a minor qualification, which does 
not amount to indicating a line of reasoning.) 
“Portuguese merchants came to dominate Indian Ocean trade by organizing themselves into powerful 
joint-stock companies.” (Not a historically defensible claim.) 
“Despite its small size and population, Portugal used its location on the Atlantic Ocean to transform 
itself into a major maritime power” (Does not respond to the prompt directly.) 

B. Contextualization (0-1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point for contextualization by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. 
To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, 
or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not 
awarded for merely a phrase or reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to Portuguese impact and/or maritime 
trade in the Indian Ocean in the period before or during the arrival of the Portuguese.  

Examples of acceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“For centuries before the arrival of European merchants, the Indian Ocean had been the center of 
flourishing trade routes connecting India to East and Southeast Asia as well as with East Africa, Egypt, 
and Arabia.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 
“Portugal’s naval advances such as stronger ships allowed the Portuguese to engage in transoceanic 
trade.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“The Indian Ocean sea trade before 1500 has been described as a maritime equivalent of the overland 
Silk Roads.” (While potentially relevant, this statement does not sufficiently describe how this context was 
relevant to Portuguese maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 
“Portugal’s naval advances made it a major player in European political rivalries. (While potentially 
relevant, this statement does not sufficiently describe how this context was relevant to Portuguese maritime 
trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 

C. Evidence (0-3 points) 

a) Document Content — Addressing the Topic (1 point) 

In order to achieve the first point, the response must use the content of at least three documents to address the 
topic of the prompt (1 point). To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately 
describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of 
how the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Examples of describing the content of a document:  

• 

• 

(Document 3): “The anonymous Portuguese court official is arguing that Portugal should do all it can 
to prevent Turkish merchants from establishing direct trade between India and the Ottoman Empire.” 
(Describes the document accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie 
the description to an argument in response to the prompt.) 
(Document 4): “The letter by the ruler of Aceh asks the Ottoman sultan for help against the attacks of 
the Portuguese.” (Describes the document accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but 
does not explicitly tie the description to an argument in response to the prompt.) 

b) Document Content – Supporting an Argument (1 point) 

In order to achieve the second point for evidence from the documents, the response needs to support an 
argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least six documents.  

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 

• 

• 

(Document 4): “The ruler of Aceh, Alauddin al Kahar, wrote to the Ottoman sultan complaining of the 
devastating impact the Portuguese had on the long distance trade from ‘all the ports of Indonesia,’ as 
well as on the pilgrimage from Aceh to Mecca. Alauddin’s letter describes the Portuguese wreaking 
havoc on Acehnese ships by intercepting them in the ocean, attacking and sinking them, or capturing 
and enslaving the passengers. This shows how long-established trade routes were completely 
disrupted by the Portuguese.” (Accurately describes and connects the content of the document to an 
argument about the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the 
sixteenth century.) 
(Document 6): “The Venetian trader Cesare Federici’s account shows how in Cambay the Portuguese 
are almost completely dependent on their Hindu brokers to carry out their trade, showing that the 
Portuguese adapted to existing Indian Ocean trade.” (Accurately describes and connects the content of 
the document to an argument about the extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century.) 

c) Evidence beyond the Documents (1 point) 

The response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the 
documents) relevant to an argument that addresses how the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the 
Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century (1 point). To earn this point, the evidence must be described, and it must 
be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence used 
to earn the point for contextualization.  

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn 
from the documents.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond the documents 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt:  

• 

• 

“Much like the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire of Iran was a major Muslim state whose power 
served as a check to Portuguese expansion in the Indian Ocean region.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt.) 
“Although spices remained the main commodity drawing Portuguese merchants to India, Indian cotton 
textiles were also imported and became increasingly popular in Europe.” (Provides a piece of evidence 
not in the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt.) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (2 points) 

Document Sourcing (0-1 point) 

For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, 
historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt (1 point). To earn 
this point, the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of 
view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of 
the three documents sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view:  

• 

(Document 2): “Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese official stationed at a trading post on the Malabar coast, 
described the great wealth and independence from political authority that Muslim traders in Calicut 
had enjoyed before the arrival of the Portuguese. Barbosa states that Muslims would have taken over 
the whole Malabar coast ‘if the king of Portugal had not discovered India’ and ‘made himself master 
there,’ a statement that demonstrates how the as a Portuguese government official he is biased against 
Muslims and is willing to trumpet Portuguese achievements. (Provides sourcing regarding the point of 
view of the document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 

• 

(Document 1): “Since the Muslim merchants of Calicut were desperately trying to convince the Hindu 
ruler of Calicut to act against the Portuguese, they used a much more direct language than one would 
expect to see in an address by subjects to their king. For example, they state that the ruler is 
dishonoring himself by his actions and is emboldening the Portuguese to hold him in contempt.” 
(Provides sourcing regarding the purpose of document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: 

• 

(Document 7): “The fact that Gujarati artists and craftsmen were showing figures wearing European 
attire in their decorative scenes shows how important maritime trade between Portugal and India had 
become for both countries.” (Provides sourcing regarding the situation in which this trade good was 
produced relevant to an argument addressing the prompt.) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: 

• 

(Document 4): “The letter by the ruler of Aceh, being an appeal to a fellow Muslim ruler, repeatedly 
flatters the Ottoman sultan, calls the Portuguese “infidels,” and emphasizes the danger they pose to the 
Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.” (Provides sourcing regarding the audience of the letter relevant to an 
argument addressing the prompt.)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding (0-1 point) 

The response demonstrates a complex understanding of how the Portuguese affected Indian Ocean maritime 
trade in the sixteenth century, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the 
question.  

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Considering the totality of the evidence and perspectives presented in the documents as demonstrated 
by creating a complex argument, while at the same time recognizing that some documents corroborate, 
qualify, or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative

Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ ability to articulate and defend an argument based on 
evidence within historical documents. This Document-Based Question (DBQ) asked students to evaluate the 
extent to which the Portuguese transformed maritime trade in the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century. The 
question addressed Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of the AP World History Course Framework, notably the 
early modern expansion of transoceanic voyaging and the changes brought to Indian Ocean trading networks 
with the establishment of a Portuguese trading-post empire. The question also addressed the use of 
mercantilist practices and armed trade for profit and for the reinforcement of state power, as well as 
fluctuations in the relative political and economic power of elite groups. The question provided opportunities 
for students to demonstrate all four of the historical reasoning skills, with a central focus on the skill of 
explaining Continuity and Change over Time. Responses were also expected to demonstrate the disciplinary 
practices of Analyzing Historical Evidence (primary sources) and Argument Development. The six text-based 
documents provided evidence of trade relationships as interpreted by local Malabar Coast residents 
(merchants and scholars), as viewed from a European perspective (Portuguese government officials as well as 
a private trader), and as seen by a Sumatran ruler. The final document was an image of an artifact illustrating 
the Portuguese luxury-goods trade in the Indian Ocean. Responses were expected to evaluate these various 
primary sources, to add additional relevant historical detail, and to utilize the pieces of evidence singly and in 
combination to support and qualify a historical argument, as well as to contextualize that argument within 
broader historical developments. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 7 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it identifies two different categories of transformation 
brought about by the Portuguese “removing trade from the ‘traditional’ Muslim merchants” and “imparting 
trade regulations and restrictions on other empires.” This is preceded by a statement that acknowledges 
obstacles and ongoing resistance to Portuguese domination. The response also earned 1 point for 
contextualization because it discusses (in the introductory paragraph) some geographic, economic, and 
political factors that led to European interest in overseas exploration and the spice trade. Further historical 
context is provided by the discussion (in the second paragraph) of the unifying role of Islam in Indian Ocean 
trade before the arrival of the Portuguese.  

The response earned 2 points for using evidence from the documents because the contents of all seven 
documents are both described accurately and also used explicitly in support of the argument — for example, 
the use of Documents 1, 2, and 3 to show Portuguese displacement of Muslim commercial rivals in India is 
followed by the statement “[t]hus, removing Muslim merchants from trading power was essential in improving 
Portuguese trade.” The response also earned 1 point for using evidence beyond the documents because it 
includes several details not mentioned in the documents (sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, Mansa 
Musa’s pilgrimage to Mecca, etc.) that are relevant to the essay’s argument in response to the prompt.

2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  

The response earned 1 point for document sourcing because it accurately explains how the author’s point of 
view, purpose, intended audience, and/or the historical situation in which the document was produced are 
relevant to the contents of Documents 1, 2, 4, and 5. For Document 1, the response offers analysis of the 
historical situation (near the bottom of page 1); for Document 2, analysis of both the historical situation and the 
author’s point of view/purpose (top of page 2); for Document 4, analysis of the document’s purpose (top of page 
3); and, for Document 5, analysis of the author’s point of view (middle of page 4). 

The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it uses multiple documents 
to provide a strongly corroborated argument for each of the categories of analysis that is attempted, but also 
demonstrates a recognition of historical complexity and nuance, acknowledging both changes that occurred as 
a result of the arrival of the Portuguese, but also continuities with previous periods. Furthermore, the response 
demonstrates an ability to recognize and analyze the agency of multiple historical actors, pointing out that local 
intermediaries often modified or limited the Portuguese merchants’ freedom of action (Document 6 is used 
insightfully to that effect on pages 3–4). 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 4 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it identifies several effects of the arrival of the 
Portuguese on Indian Ocean trade (“implimenting persecutionary restrictions,” “piracy covered up as saftey 
proceedures,” and “involving European influence and commodity prefrence in India.”) The response also 
earned 1 point for contextualization because it mentions (at the beginning of the introductory paragraph) some 
historical developments relevant to early Portuguese maritime exploration, for example, the use of lateen sails 
and the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu Dias. 

The response earned 2 points for using evidence from the documents because all seven documents are 
successfully described, and six of the seven documents are sufficiently well linked to claims or arguments 
made in the response. (The exception is Document 1, which is used on page 3, but it is not clear how its use is 
connected to the argument). However, the response did not earn the point for using evidence beyond the 
documents because the only specific evidence outside of the documents is in the introductory paragraph 
(compasses, lateen sails, Bartolomeu Dias’s navigation), where it was credited toward the contextualization 
point. 

The response did not earn the point for document sourcing. There are minimally developed successful 
sourcing attempts for Document 6 (for purpose, on page 4) and Document 1 (for purpose, on page 3); however, 
the third sourcing attempt, for Document 3 (on page 2) is insufficiently developed and involves a 
misinterpretation of the document’s point of view. The response did not earn the point for demonstrating a 
complex understanding because the argument is a straightforward change-over-time narrative that neglects 
substantial continuities and nuances that could be gleaned from the documents, and the various pieces of the 
argument in the response are somewhat disjointed rather than being effectively integrated.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued)  

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim because it mentions two Portuguese approaches to influencing 
Indian Ocean trade — alliances with local rulers (“getting close with the Ruller of Calicut”) followed by the use 
of force “by sinking ships and charging fees to pass.” Although not well developed, that is a historically 
defensible claim that addresses the prompt. However, the response did not earn the point for contextualization 
because it contains no attempt to provide relevant historical context for its claims or arguments. 

The response earned 1 point for using evidence from the documents because the contents of Documents 2, 3, 
4, and 5 are sufficiently well described. However, because the descriptions of these documents are not clearly 
connected, either explicitly or implicitly, to an argument relevant to the prompt, the response did not earn the 
second evidence point. Similarly, the response did not earn the points for evidence beyond the documents or 
for sourcing of the documents because it did not contain clearly identifiable attempts to address either task. 

The response did not earn the point for complexity because the argument attempts are not sufficiently accurate 
or detailed to demonstrate a complex understanding.
