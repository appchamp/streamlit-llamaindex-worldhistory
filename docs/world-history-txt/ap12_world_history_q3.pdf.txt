                1 Point  

•  Makes at least ONE explicit, concrete, and factually correct statement of similarity 
or difference between the effects of the Columbian Exchange in the two regions. 
The statement must also be a comparison that is different from the ones used to

2012 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to identify and explain similarities and differences in the 
demographic and environmental effects of the Columbian Exchange from 1492 to 1750 on two regions: the 
Americas and either Asia, Africa, or Europe. Students were required to choose one of three regions (Asia, 
Africa, or Europe) to compare and contrast with the Americas. The question was intended to assess 
students’ knowledge of Key Concept 4.1.V, including each of the subpoints A through E. It was also 
intended to assess students’ historical thinking skills, particularly comparison and contextualization  
(Skill 3), and their thematic understanding of Period 4 (1450–1750), particularly as it relates to Theme 1: 
Interaction Between Humans and the Environment.  

Sample: 3A  
Score: 8 

In this essay the first sentence is the thesis, and it both qualifies similarities and differences and addresses 
demographics and environmental effects (1 point). The student makes an explicit statement about 
differences in the population of Africa and the Americas (1 point). The student addresses similarities 
regarding the movements of populations, and differences in the extent and location of deforestation  
(2 points). Causes for the changes in population size in both Africa and the Americas are offered (1 point). The 
student presents at least two pieces of evidence regarding the environmental and demographic effects in 
Africa, and more than five pieces of evidence regarding those effects in the Americas (2 points). This essay 
earned a score of 8; all of the basic core points were satisfied, and 1 expanded core point was awarded for 
consistent efforts to offer analysis. 

Sample: 3B  
Score: 4 

In this essay the attempted thesis in the last paragraph does not adequately qualify differences. The student 
makes an explicit statement regarding the increase of European populations and the decline of American 
populations as a result of the Columbian Exchange (1 point). There are no other adequate attempts to address 
similarities or differences in demographic or environmental effects. Smallpox is offered as the reason for the 
decline in the American population (1 point). The student presents at least two pieces of evidence regarding 
the environmental or demographic effects in Europe and more than five pieces of evidence regarding those 
effects in the Americas (2 points). This essay earned a score of 4 for direct comparison, analysis, and 
evidence.  

Sample: 3C  
Score: 1 

In this essay there is no thesis; the statements in the first and last paragraphs do not qualify similarities or 
differences. The student makes one explicit statement of difference regarding the increase of the 
American population and the decrease in African population (1 point). There are no other adequate 
attempts to address similarities or differences in demographic or environmental effects. No explanations are 
offered as to the effects of the Columbian Exchange. The student presents only one piece of evidence 
regarding the environmental or demographic effects on the Americas and only one piece of evidence 
regarding the environmental or demographic effects on Africa. This essay earned a score of 1 for direct 
comparison.
