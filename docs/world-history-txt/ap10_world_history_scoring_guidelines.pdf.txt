Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence)   

1.  Has acceptable thesis.   

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must explicitly state at least one similarity and one difference in the 

characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry in Japan and India as 
evidenced in the documents. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified conclusion 

of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  Thesis statements such as “there were more similarities than differences” are not   

acceptable. 

•  The thesis CANNOT count for any other point. 

2.  Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
•  Students must address all 10
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least nine

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of a document by 

grouping it in regard to a specified characteristic of the mechanization of the cotton 
industry. 

•  Restating or quoting the content of the documents separately does not adequately 

demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the 
 documents. 

cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

      For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the 
 documents. 

cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

4.  Analyzes point of view in at least two documents.  

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two

 documents. 

1 Point 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular 

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description by identifying a plausible tone, 
the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the 
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

o  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but 
must move beyond a mere statement of “bias” by providing some plausible 
analysis. 

o  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.

it.
