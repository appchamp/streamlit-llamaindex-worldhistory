Document 3

1949. 

More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their 
food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and 
stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous 
areas. 

I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of 
technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life. Our aim 
should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts, to produce more 
food. The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit— has no place in our plans. 

Document 4

Revolution research, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Nobel Lecture, 1970. 

In the developing countries, . . . the land is tired, worn out, depleted of plant nutrients, and 
often eroded; crop yields have been low, near starvation level, and stagnant for centuries. 
Hunger prevails, and survival depends largely upon the annual success or failure of the 
cereal crops. 

. . . 

For the underprivileged billions in the forgotten world, hunger has been a constant 
companion, and starvation has all too often lurked in the nearby shadows. To millions of 
these unfortunates, who have long lived in despair, the Green Revolution seems like a 
miracle that has generated new hope for the future. 

. . . 

The Green Revolution has won a temporary success in man’s war against hunger and 
deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can 
provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening 
power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the Green 
Revolution will be ephemeral only.

Document 5

(1964–1967), in his 1970 interview. 

Farmers in the Punjab [a state in northwest India] were the pioneers of Green Revolution 
technology. If not for them, I am convinced we would not have made a success of it. They 
had developed into a very hardy lot of enterprising people. And therefore when this new 
technology was offered to them, they took to it like fish to water. Everybody competed 
with one another to demonstrate that he was best able to utilize the new technology.

United Nations official, circa 1970. 

If you fly from Tucson, Arizona, to Hermosillo, Mexico, what you are going to see is a 
type of agriculture that makes you rich, so rich. You will see houses like you’ve never seen 
in Mexico City, swimming pools and everything. They have such a lot of money. The 
ladies of these rich Mexican farmers like to save, so they form a club, and once a month 
they go to Tucson [to shop]. Some saving!

How the Green Revolution affects rural people depends on whether they are wage earners, 
cultivators or consumers, whether they come from landed or landless, rich or poor, male-or 
female-headed households. 

Studies on the impact of the Green Revolution have shown that technological change can 
generate major social benefits but at the same time generate significant costs for particular 
categories of rural women that are different in kind and in intensity from those experienced 
by men. 

It has: 

(cid:129) 

increased the need for  cash incomes in rural households to cover the costs of 

seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, forcing women to work as agricultural laborers; 

(cid:129) 

increased the need for unpaid female  labor for farming tasks thereby augmenting 

women’s already high labor burden; 

(cid:129) 

limited women’s wage-earning oppor tunities through mechanization.

Document 8 

Source:  Dr. Vandana Shiva, Indian physicist, from her article in the Ecologist, an 
environmental affairs magazine, 1991. 

The Green Revolution has been a failure. It has led to reduced genetic diversity, increased 
vulnerability to pests, soil erosion, water shortages, reduced soil fertility, micronutrient 
deficiencies, soil contamination, reduced availability of nutritious food crops for the local 
population, the displacement of vast numbers of small farmers from their land, rural 
impoverishment, and increased tensions and conflicts. The beneficiaries have been the 
agrochemical industry, large petrochemical companies, manufacturers of agricultural 
machinery, dam builders, and large landowners. 

The Punjab is frequently cited as the Green Revolution’s most celebrated success story. 
Yet, far from bringing prosperity, two decades of the Green Revolution have left the 
Punjab riddled with discontent and violence. Instead of abundance, the Punjab is beset 
with diseased soils, pest-infested crops, waterlogged deserts, and indebted and 
discontented farmers. Instead of peace, the Punjab has inherited conflict and violence. 

Traditionally, irrigation was only used in the Punjab as an insurance against crop failure in 
times of severe drought. The new seeds, however, need intensive irrigation as an essential 
input for crop yields. One result of the Green Revolution has therefore been to create 
conflicts over diminishing water resources. Intensive irrigation has led to the need for 
large-scale storage systems, centralizing control over water supplies and leading to both 
local and interstate water conflicts.

Document 9

Source:  Human Development Report, issued by the government of the State of Punjab, 
India, 2004. 

An important social effect of the Green Revolution was the disappearance of caste 
rigidities and the emergence of the middle and rich peasants as the dominant peasantry  
in the state. The Green Revolution also brought changes in lifestyle. Aspirations increased
—there was demand for better education for children, better housing, and better consumer 
goods. The traditional “extended family” system was gradually replaced by the “nuclear 
family.” 

Document 10 

Source:  Guatemalan National Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Peasants, a rural 
labor organization in Latin America, official statement, November 2006. 

The diversity of native seeds is the heritage of the Maya and indigenous people at  
the service of all of humanity. The Maya indigenous peoples have stood firm defending 
these seeds, which have fed us for more than five thousand years. It saddens us to 
remember the loss of respect for our seeds, due to the imposition of the Green Revolution. 
The “revolution” actually sterilized and contaminated our seeds, as well as nature and 
Mother Earth.
