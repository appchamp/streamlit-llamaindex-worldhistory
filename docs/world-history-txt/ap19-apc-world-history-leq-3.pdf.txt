Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically 
defensible claim about the extent to which 
technological innovations or transfers led to increased 
economic growth in the period 600 to 1450 C.E., with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, 
but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 
Examples: 

•  

•  

“In the period 600-1450 C.E., the Abbasid Caliphs 
promotion of science and trade led economic 
growth by expanding mathematical and 
geographic knowledge as well as by encouraging 
the development of new economic practices such 
as the use of camels and caravans.” (Responds to 
the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes 
a line of reasoning.) 
“Trade in particular grew in the period because of 
the invention of tools such as the compass.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally 
acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning.) 

To earn this point, the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to technological innovations/transfers 
and increased economic growth in the period circa 600 
to 1450 C.E. 

Example: 

•  

“In Eurasia, the period 600 to 1450 was one of 
greatly increased connections between regions, 
caused in large part by the spread of religions 
such as Islam and Buddhism.” (Relates broader 
events and developments to the topic.)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn the first point, the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to whether 
technological innovations or transfers led to increased 
economic growth in the period 600 to 1450 C.E.

Scoring note: Count new commercial practices as 
technologies; count camels, caravans, and caravansarais 
as technologies. 

Example (acceptable): 
•  

“One innovation that encouraged economic growth 
during this period was the practice of merchants 
carrying letters of credit instead of cash.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

Example (unacceptable): 
•  

“During the period 600-1450 C.E., economic growth 
occurred because of the expansion of trade 
networks and the rise in economic productive 
capacity.” (Does not count toward earning the point 
because there is no specific information beyond what 
is provided in the introductory statement.) 

OR 

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument 
in response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., technological 
innovations treated separately from technological 
transfers), then the response can earn the second evidence 
point by using only one specific historical example for 
each part of the multipart argument (but the total number 
of examples used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  

Innovations in navigational technology (compass, 
astrolabe, lateen sail, stern-post rudder, etc.) helped 
significantly increase the volume and extent of 
trade in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. 
•   New crops (such as Champa rice in China) greatly 
boosted agricultural productivity in some regions 
and led to considerable economic growth.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•   New agricultural technologies and innovations, 

(such as the three-field system, the heavy plow, the 
horse collar, windmills, etc.) boosted economic 
productivity, which permitted more people to 
engage in commercial activities and move to urban 
areas. 

•   Scientific and technological exchanges between 

regions (such as the transfer of Indian numbers to 
the Abbasid Empire and subsequently to Europe, 
the transfers Muslim and Greco–Roman science to 
Europe via Muslim al-Andalus, or the transfer of 
Chinese technologies via the Mongol Empires) led 
to advances in mathematics, engineering, and 
manufacturing, which in turn increased economic 
growth. 

•   Some innovative state practices, such as the 

Chinese use of paper money or the Mongol post 
system, contributed to economic growth. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain the extent 
to which technological innovations or transfers led to 
increased economic growth in the period from 600 to 1450 
C.E. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•   Explaining how technological innovations or 

transfers led directly to economic growth by making 
production of and/or trade in goods faster, cheaper, 
or more efficient 

•   Explaining how technological innovations or 

transfers led indirectly to economic growth by 
increasing demand for goods, freeing up labor 
supply, or concentrating producers and consumers 
in cities 

OR 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•   Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument that discusses 
technology as one factor affecting economic growth 
in that period (among other factors such as political 
change, spread of religions, or environmental 
processes)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

•   Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument 
that explains how technological innovations of 
transfers, which usually lead to increased 
economic growth, may, in some cases or 
circumstances, have negative or unintended 
economic consequences (for example, soil 
erosion and salinization in heavily cultivated 
areas of the Mediterranean or the Middle East or 
the inflationary effects of paper money in Song 
and Yuan China) 

•   Explaining relevant and insightful connections 
across time and space, such as explaining why 
the economic effects of technological innovations 
and transfers during the period 600–1450 C.E. 
were smaller and more limited in scope compared 
to the economic effects of technological 
innovations and transfers in the period after  
1450 C.E.  

This demonstration of complex understanding must be

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•   Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•   Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•   Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased 
economic growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Scoring Note: Student responses may discuss advances in agricultural, commercial, or financial practices under the 
rubric of “technological innovations.” 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

•  

•  

•  

“In the period 600-1450 C.E., the Abbasid Caliphs promotion of science and trade led economic growth 
by expanding mathematical and geographic knowledge as well as by encouraging the development of 
new economic practices such as the use of camels and caravans.” (Responds to the prompt with an 
evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“In Europe, new commercial and financial practices developed during the late Middle Ages that greatly 
expanded the economy and prosperity some regions such as Renaissance Italy or the cities of the 
Hanseatic League” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning.) 
“Trade in particular grew in the period because of the invention of tools such as the compass.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning.)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

•  

•  

•  

•  

“Technological advances and transfers often contributed to increased economic growth in the period 
between 600 and 1450 C.E.” (Offers a historically defensible claim, but it includes no additional 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“Technological innovations in the period 600-1450 C.E. completely transformed the agricultural 
economies of the previous period into commercial economies.” (Not a historically defensible claim.)  
“Between 600 and 1450 C.E., many important technologies spread from one Eurasian region to another 
via the Silk Roads.” (Potentially relevant to the prompt, but it does not reference a specific technology or an 
effect on economic growth.)  
“During this period, great changes occurred because of the invention of the compass.” (Potentially 
relevant but has no clear link to trade or economic growth.) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point, 
the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame from 600 to 1450 C.E. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point, the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to technological innovations/transfers 
and increased economic growth in the period circa 600 to 1450 C.E. 

Examples of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

•  

•  

“The Crusades, for example, despite being a religious and political conflict, also made it possible for 
scientific knowledge and new technologies to be exchanged between the Muslim world of the eastern 
Mediterranean and the Christian world of western Europe.” (Relates broader events and developments to 
the topic.) 
“In Eurasia, the period 600 to 1450 was one of greatly increased connections between regions, caused 
in large part by the spread of religions.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic.) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

•  

•  

“The Crusades were one of the most significant historical developments during this period.” 
(Potentially relevant, but it is merely a reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe,” nor does 
it provide a link to technology or economic growth.) 
“In Mesoamerica, the Maya developed highly sophisticated mathematical and astronomical knowledge 
to use in performing their religious ceremonies.” (Potentially relevant but has no clear link to technology 
or economic growth.)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point, the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of whether technological 
innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period circa 600 to 1450 C.E. These examples 
of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.  

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

“One innovation that encouraged economic growth during this period was the practice of merchants 
carrying letters of credit instead of cash.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific 
historical example relevant to the prompt.) 

•

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

“During the period 600-1450 C.E., economic growth occurred because of the expansion of trade 
networks and the rise in economic productive capacity.” (Does not count toward earning the point 
because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement.) 

•

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point, the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding the extent to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased economic 
growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

•  

“Maritime trade was one area of increased economic growth that greatly benefitted from technological 
innovations and transfers in this period. In both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean economic 
growth received a boost from the increased volume of trade resulting from the expanded use of 
astrolabes, compasses, lateen sails (originally developed in the dhows of the Indian Ocean), stern-post 
rudders, and overall sturdier ship designs.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate support 
of an argument that addresses the prompt.)

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the extent 
to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period from 600 to 
1450 C.E. To earn this point, the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or 
structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•   Explaining how technological innovations or transfers led directly to economic growth by making 

production of and/or trade in goods faster, cheaper, or more efficient 

•   Explaining how technological innovations or transfers led indirectly to economic growth by increasing 

demand for goods, freeing up labor supply, or concentrating producers and consumers in cities 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the extent to which technological 
innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. by using 
evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.  

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•   Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or 

alternative perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that discusses technology as one 
factor affecting economic growth in that period (among other factors such as political change, spread of 
religions, or environmental processes) 

•   Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that explains how technological innovations of transfers,

economic effects of technological innovations and transfers during the period 600-1450 C.E. were smaller 
and more limited in scope compared to the economic effects of technological innovations and transfers in 
the period after 1450 C.E.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ knowledge of the technological 
developments in the years 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. that impacted economic growth. The question addressed Key 
Concepts 3.1.I, 3.3.II, and 3.3.III from the AP World History Curriculum Framework. The question primarily 
tested students’ ability to deploy the historical reasoning skills of Causation and Contextualization and the 
history disciplinary practice of Argument Development. Students were not, however, limited to using the skill 
of causation as there were opportunities to demonstrate historical understanding by comparing the relative 
impacts of a variety of technological developments in different areas (e.g., navigational technologies compared 
to overland travel technologies) or technological developments in different regions (e.g., the impact of 
technological developments in China compared to the impact of technological developments in Europe). The 
question was open geographically to allow responses from multiple areas, with a specific chronological tie to 
the Post-Classical Era. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 6 

The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim at the end of the first paragraph. The thesis identifies specific 
innovations (“dhows with lateen sails” and “the proliferation of banking and credit systems”) that “caused 
economic growth across Eurasia.” The response also earned 1 point for contextualization. The introductory 
paragraph contains an effective contextualizing discussion addressing the collapse of classical empires at the 
beginning of the period 600–1450 C.E., the persistence of some earlier trade networks, and the relative isolation 
of medieval Europe from the rest of Afro–Eurasian trade.  

The response earned 2 points for evidence. There is plentiful evidence provided, and it is clearly and explicitly 
used in support of multiple arguments, often linking several categories of historical analysis throughout the 
response. For example, the discussion of the dhow and the lateen sail (paragraph 2) not only reveals 
knowledge of the basic importance of these technological developments in stimulating economic growth, but 
also explains their precise application in Indian Ocean trade, cites archaeological evidence (Abbasid coins 
found in India) illustrating the effects of their use, and offers a brief evaluation of the effects of dhow trade on 
Abbasid economic growth. Similarly, the discussion of credit arrangements in China is explicitly linked to 
more funds available for elite art patronage and thereby to “the increased cultural productivity of the Tang and 
Song Chinese.” Lastly, the discussion of the use of camel caravans on the trans-Saharan trade routes is used 
to illustrate the growing wealth of sub-Saharan elites, culminating in the pilgrimages of Mansa Musa. 

With regard to the Analysis and Reasoning category, the response earned both the historical reasoning point 
and the complexity point. There are plentiful examples of successful deployment of multiple historical 
reasoning skills throughout, including multilayered cause-and-effect explanations for all three main lines of 
argument, explorations of the cultural and political effects of economic transformations, as well as insightful 
comparisons across other periods (both in the contextual discussion in the introductory paragraph and, in the 
second paragraph, in the comparison of West Asia–South Asia economic connections during the Hellenistic 
period and after the emergence of Islam). Overall, the response builds a nuanced and complex argument that is 
extremely well supported with evidence.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 4 

The response earned 1 point for the thesis/claim located in the first paragraph. The response states that “the 
transfer [of the] compass and stirrup through silk road trade increased economic growth.” Although open to 
debate, that claim nonetheless establishes a historically defensible position and indicates, however minimally, 
a line of reasoning that is then developed in the rest of the response. The response did not, however, earn the 
point for contextualization. The opening sentence of the introductory paragraph does seem to be an attempt to 
situate the argument in a broader context, but it is limited to truisms (“Trade has always been an important 
part of human society. Trade not only helps goods spread throughout the world but it also helps with cultural 
diffusion and economic growth”) that are not connected to actual historical events or processes. 

The response earned 2 points for evidence, albeit by providing the minimum of information necessary to do so. 
Both in terms of the number of specific pieces of evidence identified (two, the compass and the stirrup) and in 
terms of the way in which the evidence is used to support the argument (descriptions of the uses of these 
technologies, connected to general claims that they facilitated trade because they “both help people move from 
one place to another”) the evidence discussion is only barely sufficient to earn the points. 

The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning because it successfully develops an argument explaining 
causal connections between the technological innovation evidence presented and its effect on trade. This is 
accomplished in the second paragraph, where the response connects the navigational advantages of the 
compass to the ability to search for new, shorter trade routes that ultimately increased trade profitability. The 
response did not, however, earn the point for complexity because its argument is mainly straightforward, with 
minimal development of explanation or nuance. 

Sample: 3C  
Score: 2 

The response earned 1 point for the thesis/claim located in the first paragraph. The response states, “New 
technological innovations such as stirrups, the magnetic compass, and junkships had a huge impact on 
increased economic growth.” While oversimplified, this claim nonetheless establishes a historically defensible 
foundation for the response and indicates a minimally acceptable line of reasoning. The response did not earn 
the point for contextualization because there is no discernible attempt to provide contextual information. 

The response earned 1 point for evidence. While two technological innovations, the stirrup and the compass, 
are discussed, each in its own short paragraph, only the discussion of the stirrup is clearly, albeit weakly, 
linked to an argument or claim about trade (“[p]erhaps the reason why the stirrup contributed so much to the 
economic growth in this time period is because it allowed merchants to travel much faster”). The discussion of 
the compass, on the other hand, indicates only an understanding of the navigational uses of this technology, 
not of its effects on trade. The response, therefore, earned the point for identifying at least two specific pieces 
of evidence but not the point for using at least two pieces of evidence in support of an argument about the 
prompt. 

The response did not earn either the historical reasoning or the complexity point because it is very minimal 
and does not demonstrate sophisticated use of historical skills or historical reasoning processes to develop the 
argument, nor does it demonstrate awareness of historical nuance or complexity.
