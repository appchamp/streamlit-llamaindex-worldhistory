Short Answer Question 1 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the 
elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more 
constrained the power of governments, the more power is diffused, checked, and balanced, the less it will 
aggress on others and commit mass violence. At the extremes of power, totalitarian governments slaughter 
their people by the tens of millions. In contrast, many democracies can barely bring themselves to execute even 
serial murderers.” 

Rudolph Rummel, United States political scientist, 
Death by Government, 1994 

a) Identify ONE historical example of mass violence that was committed by a totalitarian state in the twentieth 

century that would support Rummel’s argument in the passage. 

b) Explain ONE historical example of a democratic state committing mass violence that would challenge 

Rummel’s argument regarding democracies and mass violence. 

c) Explain ONE development in the late twentieth century that likely shaped Rummel’s view of the relationship 

between democracy and mass violence.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  The Nazi Holocaust is an example of mass violence committed by a totalitarian state. 
•  The genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge is an example of mass violence committed by a 

totalitarian state. 

•  The liquidation of the Ukrainian kulaks under Stalin is an example of mass violence committed by a 

totalitarian state. 

•  The “Great Terror” committed by the Soviet Union under Stalin in the late 1930s is an example of mass 

violence by a totalitarian state that would support the argument in the passage. 

•  The Chinese communist government under Mao Zedong used mass violence to force people to accept 

communist policies during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

• 

In the nineteenth century European states such as Britain and France violated their democratic 
principles by using mass violence to crush African resistance to European rule. 

•  British soldiers and settlers committed mass violence against indigenous populations in Australia, 

thereby showing that democracies do commit mass violence. 

•  The firebombing of Dresden during World War II challenges the author’s argument that democracies 
will not commit acts of mass violence because the Dresden bombing was a deliberate use of terror 
designed to break the will of the German population. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Rummel’s view was likely shaped by the end of the Cold War when the United States and its 

democratic allies had emerged victorious over totalitarian regimes such as the communist Soviet 
Union. 

•  The argument in the passage was likely shaped by the development of a liberal international order 
after the Second World War, which included the development of institutions such as the United 
Nations that advocated for peace and international cooperation. 

•  Ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Serbian forces in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s would likely have 

shaped Rummel’s arguments about the relationship between democracies and mass violence because 
Serbia was an authoritarian state under Slobodan Milosevic. 

•  Rummel’s assertion that democratic states will not engage in mass violence was likely shaped by 

conservative thinkers who argued after the end of the Cold War that democracy had triumphed, every 
state would soon adopt democracy, and war between states would end.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued) 

•  The event shown in the image illustrates how Europeans were able to use their economic power 

through joint-stock companies, such as the British EIC, to weaken Asian states. 

•  The Mughal grant shows how competition between European mercantilist states and companies 

weakened Asian states by allowing Europeans to gain greater access to and control over Asian 
markets. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  The most significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and South Asia from the time of 
the image to the nineteenth century is that the image shows only the beginning of the British conquest 
of India, whereas the British gained total control over India in the nineteenth century. 

•  A significant way that the relationship between Great Britain and India changed in the nineteenth 

century is that the cooperation between the Mughals and the British shown in the image turned into 
resistance and repression as Britain crushed the great Indian rebellion (or Sepoy Mutiny) of 1857. 
•  The most significant change is that Britain gained greater power in India, which led to the collapse of 

the Indian textile industry, the spread of famine, and India’s impoverishment.

Short Answer Question 3 

•  Sedentary societies adapted their environment to support agriculture (building of irrigation systems 
and canals) and the need for protection (walled cities), while nomads were more likely to adapt their 
lifestyles to the natural environment. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  Both nomads and sedentary societies participated in and facilitated long-distance trade across Afro-

Eurasia. 

•  Rulers of both sedentary societies and nomadic societies (including nomadic rule over sedentary 

states) issued coinage to facilitate economic activity. 

•  Sedentary states and nomadic empires in Afro-Eurasia both used tribute collection to facilitate 

economic activity. 

•  Both sedentary states and nomadic empires levied taxes on their populations in order to increase their 

wealth. 

•  Nomads and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia engaged in both local and long-distance trade with 

each other because the nomads’ lack of economic specialization required that they acquire goods from 
sedentary states and because nomads frequently dominated the Silk Roads. 

•  Nomads and merchants from sedentary societies both facilitated long-distance trade in luxury goods 

across Eurasia, as nomadic elites sought to acquire luxury goods as markers of political status and 
sold their excesses to long-distance traders. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Missionaries and merchants from sedentary societies influenced nomadic peoples to adopt religions 

such as Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. 

•  One major pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia was 
technological exchange, such as when the Mongols facilitated the transfer of gunpowder from China. 
•  Sedentary societies often adopted the languages of nomadic peoples, as was evident with the spread of 

Arabic and Turkic languages. 

•  The sedentarization and Sinicization of some nomadic populations in China was one major pattern of 

cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia. 

•  One major pattern of cultural interaction between nomadic and sedentary societies in Afro-Eurasia was 

exchanges in science and learning, such as when the Mongol rulers of China facilitated the 
transmission of Islamic science, mathematics, and geographical knowledge.

Short Answer Question 4 (continued) 

•  One similarity was the emergence of new technological developments in agriculture, such as 

increasing mechanization in the period 1450–1900 and the development of new irrigation techniques 
during the Green Revolution. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

• 

Increases in food production during the Green Revolution were significantly higher than in the period 
1450–1900, as were the resulting population increases. 

•  The Green Revolution saw more sophistication as a result of greater scientific knowledge than in the 

period 1450–1900, as was evident in the introduction of new agricultural techniques such as the use of 
GMOs and the use of synthetic fertilizers. 

•  One difference between agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution was that 

agriculture in the earlier period did not significantly reduce the amount of cultivated land needed to 
sustain populations, whereas the Green Revolution did. 

•  One difference between agriculture in the period 1450–1900 and the Green Revolution was that the 

most significant developments in agriculture in the period 1450–1900 occurred in fairly wealthy states 
in Western Europe, while the Green Revolution mostly affected developing countries in Asia and Latin 
America. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

One political response to the Green Revolution was states encouraging the use of green 
agricultural techniques to sustain economic development. 
A social response to the Green Revolution was that environmentalists increasingly protested 
against the use of pesticides such as DDT. 
A political response to the Green Revolution was the weakening of socialist movements in many 
developing states such as India, as governments increasingly sought to blunt calls for land reform 
by highlighting potential technological solutions and increasing crop yields. 
One social response to the Green Revolution was protests by small farmers in both developed and 
developing countries because the expense of introducing the new farming techniques associated 
with the Green Revolution increased significantly, leading over time to the concentration of more

Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

Maximum Possible Points: 7 

“Evaluate the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in Afro-Eurasia between 1860 and 
1918.” 

Points  Rubric 

Responds to the prompt with a 
historically defensible thesis/claim 
that establishes a line of 
reasoning. 
(1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must 
make a claim that responds to the 
prompt rather than restating or 
rephrasing the prompt. The thesis 
must consist of one or more 
sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

Notes 
The thesis must take a position on the extent to which 
railroads affected the process of empire-building in Afro-
Eurasia between 1860 and 1918 and indicate some reason 
for taking that position. 

Examples: 
• 

“Although railroad construction in Asia and Africa 
greatly facilitated the development of European 
colonial empires, it also aided in the emergence of 
nationalist movements against European rule.” 
(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim 
that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads in Afro-Eurasia 
helped European imperialism because it allowed 
Europeans to increase their political power in Asia 
and Africa.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning) 

Describes a broader historical 
context relevant to the prompt. 
(1 point) 

To earn the point the response must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the role of railroads in the process of 
empire-building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries.   

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to 
broader historical events, 
developments, or processes that 
occur before, during, or continue 
after the time frame of the question. 
This point is not awarded for merely 
a phrase or reference. 

Examples:  
• 

“Railroads played an important role in the 
Industrial Revolution because they provided a 
faster and more efficient method of overland 
transport than had ever existed before. (relates 
broader events and developments to the topic) 
“Industrial Revolution technologies aided 
Europeans in the creation of large empires by 
linking places together at cheaper cost.” (relates 
broader events and developments to the topic)

Evidence from the Documents: 
Uses the content of at least three 
documents to address the topic of 
the prompt. (1 point) 

To earn 1 point the response must accurately describe — 
rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of 
the documents to address the topic of railroads and 
imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries.  

OR

document accurately, and thus is credited as 
addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie the 
description to an argument in response to the prompt) 

OR         

To earn 2 points the response must accurately describe — 
rather than simply quote — the content from at least six 
documents. In addition, the response must use the content 
from the documents to support an argument in response to 
the prompt.  

Example: 
• 

(Document 5): “The editorial to the News Chronicle 
in 1901 arguing for Britain and other European 
powers to protect their interests in Asia against the 
future Russian expansion that would follow the 
construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad 
illustrates that railroads facilitated the expansion of 
empires.” (Accurately describes and connects the 
content of the document to an argument about the 
effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-
Eurasia)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Evidence beyond the Documents: 
Uses at least one additional piece of 
specific historical evidence (beyond 
that found in the documents) 
relevant to an argument about the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point the evidence must 
be described, and it must be more 
than a phrase or reference. This 
additional piece of evidence must be 
different from the evidence used to 
earn the point for contextualization. 

Sourcing: For at least three 
documents, explains how or why 
the document’s point of view, 
purpose, historical situation, and/or 
audience is relevant to an 
argument. (1 point)

Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, 
analogous to the function of evidence drawn from the 
documents. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be 
more general statements that place an argument or a 
significant portion of it on a broader context.  

Example: 
• 

“Like the European powers, Japan developed an 
extensive railway network in Korea to facilitate its 
imperial control.” (Provides a piece of evidence not 
in the documents relevant to an argument that 
addresses the prompt) 

To earn this point the response must explain — rather than 
simply identify — how or why the document’s point of view, 
purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an 
argument that addresses the prompt for each of the three 
documents sourced.  

Examples: 
• 

(Document 3): “Because the Ottoman sultan had to 
approve the proposals mentioned in Document 3, 
the report attempts to flatter the sultan by 
emphasizing his supposed popularity among 
Muslims across the world and how the 
construction of a railroad from Damascus to Mecca 
would only increase that popularity.” (Provides 
sourcing regarding the audience of the government 
report relevant to an argument addressing the 
prompt) 
(Document 5): “As a politician, Sir Henry Norman 
is critical of Britain ‘continuing to sleep’ in terms of 
responding to Russian imperial expansion in East 
Asia, and he is interested in persuading the British 
government and public opinion to adopt a different 
policy.” (Provides sourcing regarding the POV of the 
author relevant to an argument addressing the 
prompt)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Complexity: Demonstrates a 
complex understanding of the 
historical development that is the 
focus of prompt, using evidence to 
corroborate, qualify, or modify an 
argument that addresses the 
question. (1 point) 

This understanding must be part of 
the argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Examples of demonstrating a complex understanding for this 
question might include: 
•  Considering the totality of the evidence and 
perspectives presented in the documents as 
demonstrated by creating a complex argument, while 
at the same time recognizing that some documents 
corroborate, qualify or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 

multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an 
argument that explains how European railroad 
construction simultaneously strengthened colonial 
authority in Africa and Asia while also contributing to 
growing tensions with indigenous communities and 
eventually leading to the development of nationalist 
movements 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how railroads and 
other new types of communication were used to 
strengthen nation states in the nineteenth century (e.g., 
European states, United States, Meiji Japan) or in 
premodern times (e.g., the Roman road networks or the 
Mongol postal system.)

Document Summaries and Possible Sourcing  

Document  

Summary of Content 

1. British-Indian 
Association 
petition to the 
British colonial 
government 
(1866) 

•  Claims that high-caste 

Hindus are subject to abuse 
from European passengers on 
second-class carriages and 
are forced to interact with the 
masses outside the train 
platforms. Women’s 
respectability is also 
jeopardized. 

2. Qing dynasty 
official 
memorandum to 
the court (1867) 

•  Argues that the Qing 

government should build 
railroads but should not do so 
by giving concessions to 
Western companies, unless 
they meet very stringent 
criteria. 

3. Ottoman 
government 
report (1893) 

•  Argues that the construction 
of a railroad from Damascus 
to Mecca would aid Muslims 
in traveling to the holy cities 
of Mecca and Medina and 
would increase the prestige 
of the Ottoman sultan in the 
Muslim world. It would also 
decrease reliance on 
foreign/Western ships. 

Explains the relevance of point of view, 
purpose, situation, and/or audience by 
elaborating on examples such as: 
Imposition of direct British rule 
• 
following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 
(situation) 

•  High-caste Hindus complaining about 
the lack of traditional deference shown 
to them because of their social status. 
(POV) 

•  Since the purpose is to get the 

government to act, the petition uses 
hyperbole (the analogy to the Middle 
Passage). 

•  Memorial written in the context of the 
Self-Strengthening movement and 
following the Taiping Rebellion. 
(situation) 

•  The official wants to modernize China 

without antagonizing the rural 
population. (purpose) 

•  May infer that the official advocates 
setting a very high bar for giving 
Westerners permission to build 
railways because he is in favor of the 
Chinese building the railways. 
(purpose) 

•  Report written during a period when 
the Ottoman Empire considered the 
extent of reforms needed to address 
growing Western political and 
economic dominance. (situation) 
•  Report intended to convince the sultan 
to construct a railroad and flatter him.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently, e.g., a student 

could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of this rubric require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, the essay may contain errors that do not 
detract from the overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is 
accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples (when available) are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in 
Afro-Eurasia in the period 1860–1918 and indicate some reason for taking that position. 

Examples of acceptable theses: 

• 

• 

• 

“Although railroad construction in Asia and African greatly facilitated the development of European 
colonial empires, it also aided in the emergence of nationalist movements against European rule.” 
(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads had a limited impact on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia because the 
development of advanced military weaponry and European control over maritime trade were more 
significant.” (responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The construction of railroads in Afro-Eurasia helped European imperialism because it allowed 
Europeans to increase their political power in Asia and Africa.” (Responds to the prompt with a 
minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 

Example of unacceptable theses: 

• 

• 

“The construction of railroads greatly affected European imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries.” (Merely repeats the wording of the prompt with a minor qualification, which does 
not amount to indicating a line of reasoning) 
“Railroads came to Asia and Africa too late to save the European colonial empires there from 
collapsing.” (Not a historically defensible claim)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

“Railroad construction in Afro-Eurasia influenced the development of European empires in Asia and Africa and 
the development of the Qing and Ottoman empires.” (While it provides a few concrete examples of empires, the 
sentence does not respond to the prompt directly, nor does it establish a line of reasoning.) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn a point for contextualization by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. 
To earn this point, the response must accurately and explicitly connect the context of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference. 

To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to railroads in the process of empire-
building in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  

Examples of acceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“Railroads played an important role in the Industrial Revolution because they provided a faster and 
more efficient method of overland transport than had ever existed before. (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic) 
“Industrial Revolution technologies aided Europeans in the creation of large empires by linking places 
together at cheaper cost.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization:  

• 

• 

“Railroads were a part of the Industrial Revolution.” (Potentially relevant, but neither “describes” how 
railroads were part of that context, nor offers language that could plausibly be interpreted as relevant to 
empire.) 
“European powers held a series of conferences in the late nineteenth century to defuse tensions 
between them and avert war.” (While the broader historical events described are potentially connected to 
empire, the response offers no language that could plausibly be interpreted as relevant to railroads.) 

C. Evidence (0–3 points) 

a) Document Content — Addressing the Topic (1 point) 

In order to achieve the first point, the response must use the content of at least three documents to address the 
topic of the prompt (1 point). To earn 1 point for evidence from the documents, the response must accurately 
describe — rather than simply quote — the content from at least three of the documents to address the topic of 
railroads and imperialism in Afro-Eurasia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  

Example of describing the content of a document:  

• 

(Document 1): “In its petition to the British colonial government, the British-Indian Association 
complains that Europeans in second-class carriages treat them poorly.” (Describes the document 
accurately, and thus is credited as addressing the topic, but does not explicitly tie the description to an 
argument in response to the prompt)

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

b)  Document  Content  —  Supporting  an  Argument  (1  point)  

In order to achieve the second point for evidence from the documents, the response needs to support an 
argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least six documents (2 points). 

Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document: 

• 

• 

(Document 2): “By explaining how the construction of railroads could simultaneously strengthen the 
Qing Empire economically and yet could also weaken it if Western powers were allowed to build 
railroads without considering the effects on China’s rural population, the memorandum to the Qing 
court demonstrates that railroads could have a tremendous impact on the development and survival of 
empires in Afro-Eurasia.” (Connects the contents of the document to an argument about the effects of 
railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia) 
(Document 4): “The editorial to the News Chronicle in 1901 arguing for Britain and other European 
powers to protect their interests in Asia against the future Russian expansion that would follow the 
construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad illustrates that railroads not only facilitated the expansion 
of empires, but could also threaten them by generating tensions with other states.” (Connects the 
content of the document to an argument about the effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia) 

c)  Evidence  beyond  the Documents  (1  point)  

The response must use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the 
documents) relevant to an argument that addresses the effects of railroads on empire-building in Afro-Eurasia 
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1 point). To earn this point the evidence must be described, and it 
must be more than a phrase or reference. This additional piece of evidence must be different from the evidence 
used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence from outside the documents 
will typically be more specific details relevant to an argument, analogous to the function of evidence drawn 
from the documents. 

Examples of providing an example or additional piece of specific evidence beyond the documents 
relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt: 

• 

• 

“Like the European powers, Japan developed an extensive railway network in Korea to facilitate its 
imperial control.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in the documents relevant to an argument that 
addresses the prompt) 
“Western transnational companies advocated for the creation of railroads in Latin America because it 
suited their economic interests, much as they did in Afro-Eurasia.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in

Q

uestion 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (2 points) 

Document Sourcing (0–1 point) 

For at least three documents, the response explains how or why the document’s point of view, purpose, 
historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt (1 point). To earn 
this point the response must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of 
view, purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument addressing the prompt for each of 
the three documents sourced. 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view: 

• 

(Document 5): “As a politician, Sir Henry Norman is critical of Britain ‘continuing to sleep’ in terms of 
responding to Russian imperial expansion in East Asia, and he is interested in persuading the British 
government and public opinion to adopt a different policy.” (Provides sourcing regarding the POV of the 
author relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose: 

• 

(Document 2): “By cautioning the Qing court against allowing Western investors to build railroads in 
China, while supporting the building of new transportation and communication infrastructure in 
general, Shen Baozhen is trying to convince the Qing government to modernize China using the 
country’s own resources, a position shared by many Qing officials at the time.” (Provides sourcing 
regarding the purpose of the memorandum relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a document: 

• 

(Document 6): “Ernest Roume’s speech to the colonial assembly illustrates how Europeans justified 
their imperialism in Africa by claiming that what they were doing was bringing ‘progress’ and 
‘civilization’ to a land mired in ‘poverty’ and ‘barbarism.’” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical 
situation of the document relevant to an argument addressing the prompt) 

Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience: 

• 

(Document 3): “Because the Ottoman sultan had to approve the proposals mentioned in Document 3, 
the report attempts to flatter the sultan by emphasizing his supposed popularity among Muslims across 
the world and how the construction of a railroad from Damascus to Mecca would only increase that 
popularity.” (Provides sourcing regarding the audience of the government report relevant to an argument 
addressing the prompt) 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding (0–1 point) 

The response demonstrates a complex understanding of the effects of railroads on empire-building in the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the question.

Question 1 — Document-Based Question (continued) 

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Considering the totality of the evidence and perspectives presented in the documents as demonstrated 
by creating a complex argument, while at the same time recognizing that some documents corroborate 
or qualify or modify the overall argument 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that explains how European railroad 
construction simultaneously strengthened colonial authority in Africa and Asia while also contributing 
to growing tensions with indigenous communities and eventually leading to the development of 
nationalist movements 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining how 
railroads and other new types of communication were used to strengthen nation states in the 
nineteenth century (e.g., European states, United States, Meiji Japan) or in premodern times (e.g., the 
Roman road networks or the Mongol postal system) 

This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question 

In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., different factors led to the emergence and spread of new religions and belief 
systems, such as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity. 

Develop an argument that evaluates how such factors led to the emergence or spread of one or more religions 
in this time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning (1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must make a 
claim that responds to the prompt, rather 
than merely restating or rephrasing the 
prompt. The thesis must consist of one or 
more sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically defensible 
claim about the way in which one or more factors led to the 
emergence and/or spread of one or more new religions or 
belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but 
it must identify a relevant development or developments in 
the period. 

Note: The thesis does not need to refer to a specific religion or 
belief system. The three religions listed in the introductory 
statement are provided as examples; it is not required that a 
successful thesis focus on one of these three religions. 

Examples: 

• 

• 

“Long-distance trade was the most significant factor 
in the spread of religions such as Buddhism and 
Christianity in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 
because trade facilitated greater and more enduring 
contact among cultural groups.” (Responds to the 
prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a 
line of reasoning) 
“Religions spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 
because they received state support.” (Responds to 
the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that 
establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the prompt 
(1 point) 

To earn this point the response must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the emergence and spread of new 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 
C.E. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.

Note: Contextualization attempts that refer to events after the 
period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. can earn the contextualization 
point only if the events are immediately adjacent to the 
period. 

Example: 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., large imperial 
states such as the Roman Empire and Han China 
dominated big parts of Afro-Eurasia and helped 
spread technology and religion.” (Relates broader 
events and developments to the topic) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the spread of 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 
C.E.

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points)  

To earn the second point the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., religions 
spread because of state support; religions spread because 
of trade), then the response can earn the second evidence 
point by using only one specific historical example for 
each part of the multipart argument (but the total number 
of examples used must still be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  State support helping to spread religions, such as 

Christianity under the Roman Empire and Buddhism 
under the Mauryan Empire 

•  Merchants helping to spread religions in Eurasia, such 
as the Sogdians facilitating the spread of Buddhism in 
Central Asia and Christianity to China 

•  Compatibility between religious systems helping to 

spread religious practices, such as common principles 
of Greco-Roman and Egyptian polytheistic beliefs 
contributing to the spread of the cults of Osiris and Isis 
in the Mediterranean

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about how different factors led 
to the emergence or spread of religions in 
the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how 
different factors led to the emergence or spread of religions 
in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how state support led to the spread of a 

religion or a belief system  

•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or 

volumes influenced the spread of religions or belief 
systems 

•  Explaining how different or similar factors led to the 
spread of one or more religions or belief systems in 
different places 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of the 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt (2 points) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how different factors led 
to the emergence or spread of religions in 
the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument about the interaction of 
multiple factors in the spread of religious or cultural 
tradition in this period 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
political or economic factors led not only to the spread 
but sometimes also to the transformation of religious 
traditions through cultural syncretism 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how the same 
factors that led to the spread of religions or belief 
systems in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. also 
led to the spread of religions or belief systems before 
or after that time period

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on the factors that led to the spread of religions or belief systems in the period 
600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

The thesis does not need to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: The thesis does not need to refer to a specific religion or belief system. The three religions listed in the 
introductory statement are provided as examples; it is not required that a successful thesis focus on one of these 
three religions. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“The expansion of empires and long-distance trade helped spread religions in the period 600 B.C.E. to 
600 C.E. because these processes facilitated contact between different peoples.” (Responds to the 
prompt with a claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“Long-distance trade was the most significant factor in the spread of religions such as Buddhism and 
Christianity in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because trade facilitated greater and more enduring 
contact among cultural groups.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line 
of reasoning) 
“Religions spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because they received state support.” (Responds to 
the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“New religions spread across Afro-Eurasia in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.” (Offers a historically 
defensible claim but includes no additional information beyond what is provided in the introductory 
statement and no indication of a line of reasoning.) 
“The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism to China shows that military conquest was the most 
significant factor in spreading religion in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. because rulers preferred to 
force others to accept their ideas.” (Not a historically defensible claim) 
“Afro-Eurasia was a melting pot of religious groups who shared ideas while trading.” (Potentially 
relevant to the prompt, but does not reference a specific factor leading to the spread of religions) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

To earn the point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the emergence and spread of new 
religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Note: Contextualization attempts that refer to events after the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. can earn the 
contextualization point only if the events are immediately adjacent to the period. 

Example of acceptable contextualization: (hypothetical): 

• 

“In the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., large imperial states such as the Roman Empire and Han China 
dominated big parts of Afro-Eurasia and helped spread technology and religion.” (Relates broader 
events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“Buddhism originated in India.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a reference and does not meet the 
requirement of “describe”) 
“Alexander’s conquests destroyed the Persian empire and briefly unified politically all of the eastern 
Mediterranean.” (Potentially relevant, but has no clear link to the spread of religions) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of how religions or belief 
systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. These examples of evidence must be different from the 
information used to earn the point for contextualization.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information. 

For the three religions listed in the introductory statement, general assertions that they spread during the 
period should not be credited as “specific historical examples.”  

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Emperor Constantine’s policies helped spread Christianity across the Roman Empire.” (Counts 
toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Christianity emerged and spread during the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.”(Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory 
statement) 

OR 

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how religions or belief systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Roman persecutions of Christian populations in the Mediterranean prior to 300 C.E. failed to stop the 
spread of the new religion. The emperor Constantine I recognized this fact and became convinced that 
legalizing Christianity would unify the empire and bolster his legitimacy as a ruler. So Constantine 
issued the Edict of Milan and held a great church council at Nicaea.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses the prompt) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about how 
religions or belief systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. To earn this point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might 
be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining how state support led to the spread of a religion or a belief system  
•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or volumes influenced the spread of religions or belief 

systems 

•  Explaining how different or similar factors led to the spread of one or more religions or belief systems 

in different places 

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the ways in which religions or belief 
systems spread in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an 
argument that addresses the question.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument about the interaction of 
multiple factors in the spread of religious or cultural tradition in this period 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 

complexity, such as constructing an argument that political or economic factors led not only to the 
spread but sometimes also to the transformation of religious traditions through cultural syncretism 
•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, such as explaining how the 

same factors that led to the spread of religions or belief systems in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. also 
led to the spread of religions or belief systems before or after that time period

Question 3 — Long Essay Question 

“In the period 1450−1750, oceanic voyages resulted in the Columbian Exchange, which transformed the 
Eastern and Western Hemispheres.  

Develop an argument that evaluates how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in this 
time period.” 

Maximum Possible Points: 6 

Points  Rubric  

Thesis/Claim: Responds to the prompt 
with a historically defensible 
thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning (1 point) 

To earn this point the thesis must make a 
claim that responds to the prompt, rather 
than merely restating or rephrasing the 
prompt. The thesis must consist of one or 
more sentences located in one place, 
either in the introduction or the 
conclusion.  

Notes 
The thesis statement must make a historically defensible 
claim about how the Columbian Exchange affected 
peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750, with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but 
it must identify a relevant development or developments in 
the period. 

Note: The phrase “peoples in the Americas” may mean 
Native American/Amerindian peoples OR Africans or 
Europeans living in the Americas during the time period. 

Examples: 
• 

“The Columbian Exchange had a profound impact on 
the Americas most notably by diversifying American 
populations through migrations of Europeans and 
enslaved Africans, but also by introducing new crops 
and domesticated animals.” (Responds to the prompt 
with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange had a negative effect on 
peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750 
because many of them died from European diseases.” 
(Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable 
claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 

• 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the 
prompt. (1 point) 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the effects of the Columbian Exchange 
on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference.  

Example: 
• 

“It is generally believed that the Americas were first 
settled by people from Siberia, who then remained 
isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of 
years.” (Relates broader events and developments to the 
topic)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the impact of 
the Columbian Exchange on peoples in the Americas in 
the period 1450–1750. 

Note: General assertions containing no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement should 
not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example (acceptable): 
• 

“Europeans’ attempts to reach Asia by sailing west 
resulted in Europeans’ encountering the Americas.” 
(Counts toward earning the point because there is a 
specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example (unacceptable): 
• 

“The Columbian Exchange was a direct outcome of the 
European oceanic voyages.” (Does not count toward 
earning the point because there is no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement) 

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points)  

To earn the second point the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., the Columbian 
Exchange had a detrimental impact on Native Americans but 
a beneficial impact on Europeans settling in the Americas), 
then the response can earn the second point by using only 
one specific historical example for each part of the multipart 
argument (but the total number of examples used must still 
be at least two). 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  The introduction of Eastern Hemisphere diseases such 
as measles and smallpox leading to sharp declines in 
Amerindian populations soon after the arrival of the 
Europeans. 

•  The transfer of horses and cattle allowing Europeans 
to make a living in the grasslands of North and South 
America thereby driving out Native peoples living in 
these areas. 

•  The adoption of American crops (such as corn and 
potatoes) and Amerindian agricultural techniques 
(such as the milpa or altitude-dependent agriculture in 
the Andes) allowed both European immigrants and 
enslaved African populations in the Americas to grow.

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about how the Columbian 
Exchange affected peoples in the 
Americas in the period 1450−1750 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how the 
Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in 
the period 1450−1750. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how historical isolation led to peoples in 
the Western and Western hemispheres developing a 
different set of agricultural crops and practices, as well 
as different technologies and biological/immunological 
characteristics 

•  Explaining how the population transfers following the 
European exploration and settlement of the Americas 
led to the technological, agricultural, and biological 
transfers of the Columbian Exchange  

•  Explaining the differential impacts of the processes of 
the Columbian Exchange on Amerindian, European-
American, and African-American populations in the 
Americas 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of the 
prompt, using evidence to corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument that 
addresses the prompt (2 points) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how the Columbian 
Exchange affected peoples in the 
Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing 
multiple factors or by considering diverse or 
alternative perspectives or evidence, such as 
constructing an argument that complex processes 
such as the Columbian exchange could have different, 
sometimes disparate, effects on peoples in the 
Americas (for example, the demographic catastrophe 
in the aftermath of the initial contact versus the longer-
term increased economic activity because of plantation 
agriculture) 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the 
essay to demonstrate awareness of historical 
complexity, such as constructing an argument that 
explains how the processes of the Columbian 
Exchange had both intended and unintended effects 
(for example, the deliberate introduction of Afro-
Eurasian crops and domesticated animals versus the 
unintended transfer of pathogens, disease vectors, and 
invasive species)

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how some of the 
effects of the Columbian Exchange (the demographic 
effects from the transfer of pathogens) happened 
relatively quickly, while other effects (the demographic 
and ecological effects from the adoption of new crops) 
happened over many decades or centuries, or 
explaining significant regional variations in the effect 
of the Columbian exchange on peoples in the

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point)  

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in the 
period 1450−1750. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: the phrase “peoples in the Americas” may mean Native American/Amerindian peoples OR Africans or 
Europeans living in the Americas during the time period. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange had a profound impact on the Americas most notably by diversifying 
American populations through migrations of Europeans and enslaved Africans, but also by introducing 
new crops and domesticated animals.” (Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes 
a line of reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange had a negative effect on peoples in the Americas in the period 1450−1750 
because many of them died from European diseases.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally 
acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange transformed the lives of peoples living in the Americas in the period 
1450−1750.” (Offers a historically defensible claim, but includes no additional information beyond what is 
provided in the introductory statement and no indication of a line of reasoning) 
“The Columbian Exchange affected the Americas by wiping out the Indians and giving Europeans an 
empty continent in which to settle.” (Not a historically defensible claim) 
“A strong desire to spread Christianity led Europeans to launch their transoceanic voyages in the 
1400s.” (Does not respond directly to the prompt because there is no clear link to the Columbian Exchange) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 1450–1750. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the effects of the Columbian 
Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“It is generally believed that the Americas were first settled by people from Siberia, who then remained 
isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years.” (Relates broader events and developments to 

the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“Smallpox, influenza, and plague were ‘Old World’ diseases.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a 
reference and does not meet the requirement of “describe”) 
“The Inca in South America, and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica had built the two largest Native American 
empires by 1450.” (Potentially relevant, but has no clear link to the Columbian Exchange) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the effects of the 
Columbian Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. These examples of evidence must 
be different from the information used to earn the point for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

General assertions containing no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement 
should not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Europeans’ attempts to reach Asia by sailing west resulted in Europeans’ encountering the 
Americas.” (Counts toward earning the point because there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“The Columbian Exchange was a direct outcome of the European oceanic voyages.” (Does not count 

toward earning the point because there is no specific information beyond what is provided in the 

introductory statement) 

OR 

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how the Columbian Exchange affected peoples in the Americas in the period 
1450−1750. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: 

• 

“Within a few years of their arrival in Mexico and Peru, Spanish priests and conquistadors began to 

notice that large numbers of Indians were dying of infectious disease. Illustrated Aztec and Inca 

chronicles from the first years after the conquest also show many people sick or dying from smallpox. 
There were also outbreaks of measles and typhoid. Native Americans died from these diseases in 

disproportionately high numbers, which resulted in a dramatic decline in their populations across the 

Americas.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate support of an argument that addresses 

the prompt) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the effects 
of the Columbian Exchange on the peoples in Americas in the period 1450−1750. To earn this point the 
response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument, although the 
reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 

•  Explaining how historical isolation led to peoples in the Eastern and Western hemispheres developing 

a different set of agricultural crops and practices, as well as different technologies and 
biological/immunological characteristics

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Contextualization: Describes a broader 
historical context relevant to the prompt 
(1 point) 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a 
context relevant to the ways in which twentieth-century 
political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or 
social order. 

To earn this point the response must 
relate the topic of the prompt to broader 
historical events, developments, or 
processes that occur before, during, or 
continue after the time frame of the 
question. This point is not awarded for 
merely a phrase or a reference. 

Evidence: Provides specific examples 
of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt (1 point) 

Example: 
• 

“During this time, as Germany had to pay war 
reparations in response to losing the Great War, the 
country began to economically deflate and fall into a 
Great Depression.” (Relates broader events and 
developments to the topic) 

To earn the first point the response must identify at least 
two specific historical examples relevant to the ways in 
which communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged 
the existing political, and/or social order during the 
twentieth century. 

Note: General assertions containing no specific information 
beyond what is provided in the introductory statement should 
not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example (acceptable): 
• 

“Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in which he outlined his Nazi 
ideology.” (Counts toward earning the point because 
there is a specific historical example relevant to the 
prompt). 

Example (unacceptable): 
• 

“Fascism, a twentieth-century political ideology became 
one of the major challenges to the established political 
order in that century.”(Does not count toward earning the 
point because there is no specific information beyond 
what is provided in the introductory statement).  

OR 

OR 

Supports an Argument: Supports an 
argument in response to the prompt 
using specific and relevant examples of 
evidence (2 points) 

To earn the second point, the response must use at least 
two specific historical examples to support an argument in 
response to the prompt. 

If a response has a multipart argument (e.g., Nazism 
challenged the political order; Communism did not), then the 
response can earn the second point by using only one specific 
historical example for each part of the multipart argument (but 
the total number of examples used must still be at least two).

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Evidence used to support an argument might include: 
•  The Bolsheviks’ nationalization and redistribution of 
property challenging the existing economic order by 
dispossessing former elites/capitalists and creating 
state-driven, planned economies 

•  Fascist ideology rejecting parliamentary democracy and 
individual rights liberalism and embracing instead a 
political system based on centralized personal 
leadership, propaganda, and the use of 
ultranationalist/racist policies 

•  The rise of nationalism in Asia and Africa challenging 

the global political order and leading to the 
reorganization or disappearance of European colonial 
empires 

Essays must use historical reasoning to explain how 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the 
existing political and/or social order during the twentieth 
century. 

Examples of using historical reasoning might include: 
•  Explaining how the ideologies’ ability to challenge the 

political or social order was facilitated by the two world 
wars 

•  Explaining how major changes of the political or social 
order in the twentieth century (e.g., the Versailles 
settlement or the Cold War) gave rise to new ideological 
challenges (e.g., Nazism, the Non-Aligned Movement) 

•  Explaining the effects of more than one ideology on the 

political or social order 

Historical Reasoning: Uses historical 
reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change over time) to 
frame or structure an argument that 
addresses the prompt (1 point) 

To earn the first point the response must 
demonstrate the use of historical 
reasoning to frame or structure an 
argument about the ways in which 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism 
challenged the existing political and/or 
social order during the twentieth century. 

OR 

OR 

Complexity: Demonstrates a complex 
understanding of the historical 
development that is the focus of prompt, 
using evidence to corroborate, qualify, 
or modify an argument that addresses 
the prompt (2 points) 

. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple 

factors or by considering diverse or alternative 
perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an 
argument that some ideologies may challenge certain 
aspects of the established order while reinforcing other 
aspects (e.g., fascist governments’ support for big 
business)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

To earn the second point the response 
must demonstrate a complex 
understanding of the ways in which 
communism, fascism, and/or nationalism 
challenged the existing political and/or 
social order during the twentieth century. 

This understanding must be part of the 
argument, not merely a phrase or 
reference. 

• 

•  Qualifying or modifying the main argument of the essay 
to demonstrate awareness of historical complexity, 
such as constructing an argument that explains how 
Soviet and Chinese economic policies, while outwardly 
championing the rights of industrial workers or 
peasants (as mandated by communist ideology), ended 
up enriching the communist party elite, while leading to 
the impoverishment of workers and peasants 
Explaining relevant and insightful connections across 
time and space, such as explaining how the effects of 
ideologies on the established order changed over the 
course of the century (e.g., nationalism being extremely 
disruptive of the established order in the first half of the 
century, but becoming tempered by international 
institutions and regional economic cooperation in the 
second half of the century). Or explaining how Social 
Democracy in Europe (after 1945) successfully blunted 
the extent of communism’s challenge to the established 
economic and political order by developing a system of 
mixed public-private economic policies and embracing 
parliamentary democracy

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

Scoring Notes 

Introductory notes: 

•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a 

student could earn a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible 
content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract 
from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain grammatical errors. 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by responding to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis that establishes a line 
of reasoning about the topic. To earn this point the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt 
rather than simply restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must suggest at least one main line of 
argument development or establish the analytic categories of the argument. 

The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the 
conclusion. 

The thesis must take a position on how communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the existing 
political and/or social order during the twentieth century, with some indication of the reasoning for making 
that claim. 

The thesis is not required to encompass the entire period, but it must identify a relevant development or 
developments in the period. 

Note: Nazism should be considered a form of fascism. 

Examples of acceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“The political ideologies of communism, fascism, and nationalism became prominent during the 20th  c. 
leaving many countries questioning their own governments. These challenged the existing political 
and social structures by offering new opportunities in the social order for those that were poor, and by 

promising sweeping political change to gain support of citizens.” (Responds to the prompt with an 

evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning) 
“The Cold War made it possible for decolonization movements to embrace both nationalism and 

socialism, thus challenging both the existing political order and the existing economic order.” 

(Responds to the prompt with an evaluative claim that establishes a line of reasoning)

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

• 

“Communist movements challenged the existing political order because communists believed in ‘All 
Workers Unite’.” (Responds to the prompt with a minimally acceptable claim that establishes a line of 

reasoning) 

Examples of unacceptable theses (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

• 

“Fascism was one ideology that completely disrupted the existing political order.” (Offers a historically 
defensible claim, but includes no additional information beyond what is provided in the introductory 

statement, and no indication of a line of reasoning) 

“The success of nationalist decolonization movements overhauled the established political and social 
order by ensuring that former colonial powers such as Britain, France, and the U.S. were no longer a 

factor in international relations.” (Not a historically defensible claim) 

“Communist governments in the Soviet Union and elsewhere usually nationalized factories, 
collectivized land in communal farms and invested in large-scale economic development projects (Does 

not respond directly to the prompt because there is no clear link to challenges to the existing political 

and/or social order) 

B. Contextualization (0–1 point) 

Responses earn 1 point by describing a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. To earn this point the 
response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occurred before, during, or continued after the time frame 1900–2001. This point is not awarded for merely a 
phrase or a reference. 

To earn this point the essay must accurately describe a context relevant to the ways in which twentieth-century 
political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or social order. 

Example of acceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

“Communism grew out of Marx and Engels’ observation that capitalism led to the mistreatment of 
factory workers by their bosses.” (Relates broader events and developments to the topic) 

Examples of unacceptable contextualization (hypothetical): 

• 

• 

“Fascists rejected the teachings of liberalism.” (Potentially relevant, but is merely a reference and does 
not meet the requirement of “describe”) 
“The twentieth century, especially after the end of World War I has been called the era of the nation-
state.”(Potentially relevant, but has no clear ideologies challenging the existing political and/or social 
order) 

C. Evidence (0–2 points) 

Evidence 

Responses earn 1 point by providing at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the 
prompt. Responses can earn this point without earning the point for a thesis statement. To earn this point the 
response must identify specific historical examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the ways in which

Question 4 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

communism, fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social order during the 
twentieth century. These examples of evidence must be different from the information used to earn the point 
for contextualization. 

Typically, statements credited as contextualization will be more general statements that place an argument or 
a significant portion of it in a broader context. Statements credited as evidence will typically be more specific 
information.  

General assertions containing no specific information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement 
should not be credited as “specific historical examples.” 

Example of a statement that counts toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in which he outlined his Nazi ideology.”(Counts toward earning the point 
because there is a specific historical example relevant to the prompt) 

Example of a statement that does not count toward earning 1 point for evidence (hypothetical): 

• 

“Fascism, a twentieth-century political ideology became one of the major challenges to the established 
political order in that century.” (Does not count toward earning the point because there is no specific 
information beyond what is provided in the introductory statement) 

OR  

Supports an Argument 

Responses earn 2 points if they support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant 
examples of evidence. To earn the second point the response must use specific historical evidence to support 
an argument regarding how political ideologies challenged the existing political and/or social order in the 
period 1900–2001. 

Example of successfully supporting an argument with evidence: 

• 

“The Soviet Union tried to “export” communism to other countries by funding communist parties in 
Western Europe and in Asia and, after World War II, by establishing a large network of socialist client 

states, including Cuba, Vietnam, and Angola.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence in accurate 

support of an argument that addresses the prompt) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points) 

Historical Reasoning 

Responses earn 1 point by using a historical reasoning skill to frame or structure an argument about the ways 
in which communism, fascism and/or nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social order during 
the twentieth century. To earn this point the response must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
frame or structure an argument, although the reasoning might be uneven, imbalanced, or inconsistent.

OR 

Complexity 

Responses earn 2 points by demonstrating a complex understanding of the ways in which communism, 
fascism, and/or nationalism challenged the existing political and/or social order during the twentieth century, 
by using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.  

Demonstrating a complex understanding might include: 

•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple factors or by considering diverse or alternative 

perspectives or evidence, such as constructing an argument that some ideologies may challenge 
certain aspects of the established order while reinforcing other aspects (e.g., fascist governments’
