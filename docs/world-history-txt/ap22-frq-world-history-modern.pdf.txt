SECTION I, Part B 

Time—40 minutes

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“The Mongol conquests have been defined as the last chapter of the Eurasian transformations of the tenth 
[through the] thirteenth centuries. Y  et with the same, or even better, justification they can also be regarded as 
the first chapter of a new era, perhaps the early-modern one. . . . The Mongol period w
as a significant step 
towards closer integration of the old world, both inside and outside the empire’s realm. Certainly the vast 
dimensions of the empire contributed to that, but the role of the Mongols was not limited to [being] the 
passive medium through which [their] subjects learned from one another. Instead they actively promoted 
inter-cultural exchange.” 

Michal Biran, historian, “The Mongol T  ransformation: From the Steppe to 
Eurasian Empire,” article published in 2004 

1.  a) Identify ONE economic development that would support Biran’s argument in the passage regarding the

c) Explain how ONE intercultural transfer or exchange resulted from the Mongol conquests.

Indies, letter to the Dutch colonial government in Jakarta, 1858. 

Unfortunately, many of the potential Javanese workers for the sugar processing factory are already forced to 
work on sugar fields under the Dutch government’s Cultivation System. 1 There is not a single peasant in the 
district who is not subject to multiple demands on his labor, from the government or from local Javanese 
elites. 

I have had one of my factory agents travel around the villages in the district all year looking for workers. 
Despite offering them good wages, I have never succeeded in getting more than five men per day. When I ask
the men to work in the factory full time, they all answer that they would if I could get them freed from 
government-imposed work.

Source:  Bankim  Chandra  Chatterjee,  Indian  journalist  and  intellectual,  The  Cultivators  of  Bengal,  article 
published in a Bengali-language newspaper, Kolkata, India, 1872. 

We pay for what we buy from England by exporting Indian agricultural commodities such as rice, silk, 
indigo, etc. It goes without saying that as the trade with England expands, so will the demand for such 
agricultural commodities. Ever since the establishment of British rule, the trade of India has increased, 
leading to an expansion of agriculture. 

The Indian cotton weaving trade may have collapsed because of cheap British cloth imports, but why does 
the weaver not move to another occupation? He may not be able to support his family by weaving cloth, but 
he should be able to do so if he would switch to cultivating rice. 

But people in our country are reluctant to give up their hereditary trades. This reluctance is unfortunate for
our weavers, but it does not mean a loss of wealth for India as a whole.

It used to take ten days to get twenty loads of rubber.  We were always in the forest and then if we were late 
making the delivery, we could be killed.  We had to go further into the forest to find the rubber vines and our 
women had to give up cultivating fields and gardens.  Then we starved.  Wild animals killed some of us when 
we were working in the forest, and others got lost or died from exposure and starvation.  We begged the White

After our rebellion had been put down, 1 we were offered work in the mines and farms of the White people to
earn money, and so we were able to buy back some cattle to replace the ones that had been lost during the 
rebellion.  At first, of course, we were not used to working for a wage, but the colonial government ordered 
the chiefs to advise the young people to go to work, and gradually they went. In a few years we had 
recovered our livelihoods somewhat. 

But then the taxes came.  At first, it was 10 shillings [British currency] a year. Soon the Government said, 
“This is too little, you must contribute more, you must pay one pound.”  We were also taxed 5 shillings for a 
dog.  Then the Government told us that we were living on private land that supposedly belonged to the White
settlers; the owners wanted rent in addition to the Government tax.

rule, interview conducted by  African historians from newly independent  Tanzania, published in 1967. 

In 1902, the Germans established cotton plantations in our Matumbi district. Every village was allotted days 
on which it had to cultivate the plantations. One person had to come from each household on the allotted 
days. 

This work made us suffer greatly.  We were whipped for the smallest mistake, and once you started working, 
there was no break. Some of us were assigned to clear the land of trees, others tilled the land, others would 
smooth the ground and plant the cotton seeds, another group did the weeding, another the picking, and yet 
another transported the bales of cotton to the coast beyond Kikanda for shipping. 1 The work was 
astonishingly hard and our only reward was the whip. And yet the German also w
