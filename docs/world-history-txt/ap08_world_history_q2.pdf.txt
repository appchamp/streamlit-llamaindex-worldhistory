from 650 C.E. to 1750 C.E. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay.

in Indian Ocean commerce in the period 650–1750, for example: materials  
exchanged, participants involved, and/or new technologies. 

For 1 point: 

•  The essay provides four pieces of accurate evidence of change AND/OR continuity. 

o  Each piece of evidence must be a specific example of continuity or change in  
Indian Ocean commerce in the period 650–1750, for example, materials

      over time and/or continuity. 

•  The essay relates an extraregional or global process to explain a change OR 

1 Point  

continuity in Indian Ocean commerce in the period 650–1750. For example, “The

5.   Analyzes the process of change over time and/or continuity. 

1 Point 

•  Accurately explains a reason for a change OR continuity in Indian Ocean commerce

2008 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2—Continuity/Change over Time 

Overview 

The continuity and change-over-time question asked: “Analyze the changes and continuities in commerce 
in the Indian Ocean region from 650 C.E. to 1750 C.E.” The intent of this question was to have students 
explain the reasons for the changes and continuities in commerce in the Indian Ocean region during those 
1100 years. The focus of the question, Indian Ocean trade in that time period, is considered a 
“mainstream” topic in the AP World History course. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The thesis, located in the first paragraph, is specific in terms of continuity and change and addresses the 
time frame of the question, commerce, and the Indian Ocean region (1 point). Continuity is addressed in 
the beginning of the second paragraph on the first page, and change is addressed in the first paragraph on 
the second page (2 points). Evidence of continuity is located in the second paragraph on page 1, and 
evidence of change is found in the first paragraph on the second page (2 points). Relevant global context is 
discussed in the first full paragraph of page 2 (“European states . . .”) (1 point). Analysis is included in the 
second paragraph on page 1 (“Those storehouses allowed . . .”) (1 point). An expanded core point was 
earned for the essay’s high degree of specific evidence, especially for continuity (1 point). Although the 
references to Japan and the opium trade are out of the time frame of the question, no points were 
deducted.  

Sample: 2B 
Score: 6 

The thesis, located in the first paragraph, is specific in terms of continuity and change and addresses the 
time frame of the question, commerce, and the Indian Ocean region (1 point). The discussion of society in 
China at the bottom of the first paragraph is not germane to the question, but no points were deducted. 
The essay addresses continuity in the first paragraph (“Regions around . . . other countries didn’t have”), 
and the discussion of changes begins at the bottom of page 1 (“Over time . . .”) (2 points). The essay 
presents several examples of change (introduction of Christianity; the Dutch in the Indian Ocean region; 
changes in technology such as the compass and “larger ship vassals” [sic]) and one example of continuity 
evidence (spices) (2 points). The essay provides global context by relating the link between the Indian 
Ocean region and South America to the growth of commerce in the Indian Ocean region (1 point). There is 
no analysis.  

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The attempted thesis in the introduction and conclusion does not fully address the question. The essay 
addresses change in the second paragraph (“has increased significantly over time”) and continuity on 
page 2 (“One similarity”) (2 points). The attempts to cite evidence of change in the second paragraph 
(“technology” and “advanced products”) are too vague to receive credit. The two valid, specific pieces of 
evidence in support of change (stronger ships and compasses) are too few in number to meet the core 
requirement. The two attempts to cite evidence of continuity on page 2, “places and ports,” are also too 
vague to receive credit. In an attempt to supply global context (near the bottom of the first page), the 
student lists areas that traded within the Indian Ocean region but does not fulfill the core requirement for 
global context and thus did not receive the point.
