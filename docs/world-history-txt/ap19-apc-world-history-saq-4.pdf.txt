2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 4 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify economic changes that led to the formation 
of new elites in the period 1750–1900. Students were also expected to explain how the traditional elites, despite 
economic change, remained in power in the period 1750–1900. Finally, students were expected to explain how 
the formation of the new elites led to the emergence of a new ideology in the period 1750–1900. The question 
addressed Key Concepts 5.1 and 5.2 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical 
reasoning skills of Contextualization, Causation, and Continuity and Change. 

Sample: 4A

legislative bodies (parliaments) to maintain political power. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains how poor conditions for workers led to the emergence of 

socialism. 

Sample: 4B

in the period 1750–1900 by helping the monarch rule and make laws.

the formation of new elites in the period 1750–1900.

of industrialization.
