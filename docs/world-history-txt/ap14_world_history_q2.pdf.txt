2014 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to select one of the regions provided (Latin America, including 
the Caribbean; sub-Saharan Africa; Southeast Asia) and then identify and explain changes and 
continuities in the selected region’s participation in interregional trade between circa 1500 and 1750.  In 
particular, the question measured the historical thinking skill of chronological reasoning (Skill 2), especially 
the subskill of working with patterns of change and continuity over time. The question directly addresses 
the fourth theme of the course (Creation, Expansion and Interaction of Economic Systems) within a period 
when that theme is substantially related to many other historical developments of the period (1500 – 1750). 
The question addressed directly each of the four subpoints in the Curriculum Framework Key Concept 
4.1.IV. The question is also tied to Curriculum Framework Key Concept 4.2.I B.  

Sample: 2A 
Score: 9 

There is a clear thesis in the first paragraph, including both a change and a continuity in interregional trade 
(1 point). The essay addresses change and continuity; multiple changes are addressed toward the end of the 
second paragraph and in the middle of the third paragraph, while continuity is addressed in the fourth 
paragraph (2 points). The essay includes more than six scorable pieces of evidence (2 points). The essay 
includes strong world historical context in the final paragraph (1 point). The essay includes analysis multiple 
times in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs (1 point). Multiple explanations and well-articulated world 
historical context earned the two expanded core points (2 points). 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The essay lacks an adequate thesis; the attempt to identify change is about production, while the attempt to 
identify a continuity is political. Change is adequately addressed at the bottom of the first page when 
increased plantation production is connected to trade, but continuity is not addressed (1 point). There are 
four pieces of adequate evidence (sugar, plantations, African slaves, and shipping sugar to Europe) (1point). 
There is adequate world historical context at the bottom of the first page when trade in Europe, the 
Americas, and Africa is addressed (1 point). The essay includes a reason for change in interregional trade in 
the extended discussion of the increased need for slaves because of the increased number of plantations, and 
at the bottom of the first page (1 point).  

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The essay lacks an adequate thesis; the attempt to identify continuity addresses production, not 
interregional trade, and the attempt to identify change is political not interregional trade. No points were 
earned for addressing continuity and change because the continuity attempts address production and 
imperialism, not interregional trade, while the change attempt is not within the time period. The acceptable 
evidence presented includes: sugar, slaves from Africa, crops for Europe, and colonies only trade with 
imperial powers (1 point). The world historical context addressed in the essay includes the interactions of 
three world regions: Africans sent to Caribbean islands to produce crops for Europe (1 point). The essay lacks 
analysis; no reason for change of interregional change is provided.
