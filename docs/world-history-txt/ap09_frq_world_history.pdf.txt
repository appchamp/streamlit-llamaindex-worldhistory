and develop the Niger River delta and surrounding areas, standard form signed by multiple 
African rulers, 1886.

native value.

Document 2 

Source:  Prempeh I, Ashanti leader, response to a British offer of protectorate status,  
West Africa, 1891. 

The suggestion that Ashanti in its present state should come and enjoy the protection  
of Her Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of India is a matter of very serious 
consideration. I am pleased to announce that we have arrived at the conclusion that my 
kingdom of Ashanti will never commit itself to any such policy. Ashanti must remain  
as of old and at the same time remain friendly with all White men.

Document 3

Source:  Menelik II, emperor of Ethiopia, letter to Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, 
and Russia, 1891. 

I have no intention at all of being an indifferent spectator, if the distant Powers hold onto 
the idea of dividing up Africa. For the past fourteen centuries Ethiopia has been an island 
of Christians in a sea of Pagans. 

Since the All-Powerful has protected Ethiopia up until now, I am hopeful that He will  
keep and enlarge it also in the future, and I do not think for a moment that He will divide 
Ethiopia among the distant Powers. In the past, the boundary of Ethiopia was the sea. 
Without our use of force and without the aid of the Christians, our boundary on the sea fell 
into the hands of the Muslims. Today we do not pretend to be able to recover our seacoast 
by force; but we hope that the Christian Powers, advised by our Savior, Jesus Christ, will 
restore our seacoast boundary to us, or give us at least a few ports along the coast. 

Document 4 

Source:  Ndansi Kumalo, African veteran of the Ndebele Rebellion against British 
advances in southern Africa, 1896. 

So we surrendered to the White people and were told to go back to our homes and live  
our usual lives and attend to our crops. We were treated like slaves. They came and were 
overbearing. We were ordered to carry their clothes and bundles. They harmed our wives 
and our daughters. How the rebellion started I do not know; there was no organization, it 
was like a fire that suddenly flames up. I had an old gun. They—the White men —fought 
us with big guns, machine guns, and rifles. Many of our people were killed in this fight:   
I saw four of my cousins shot. We made many charges but each time we were defeated. 
But for the White men’s machine guns, it would have been different.

Document 6 

Source:  Yaa Asantewa, Ashanti queen mother, speech to chiefs, West Africa, 1900. 

Now I have seen that some of you fear to go forward and fight for our King. If it were  
in the brave days of old, chiefs would not sit down to see their King taken away without 
firing a shot. No White man could have dared to speak to chiefs of the Ashanti in the way 
the British governor spoke to you chiefs this morning. Is it true that the bravery of the 
Ashanti is no more? I cannot believe it. Yea, it cannot be! I must say this; if you the men 
of Ashanti will not go forward, then we will. We the women will. I shall call upon my 
fellow women. We will fight the White men. We will fight until the last of us falls on the 
battlefields.

Document 7 

Source:  Samuel Maherero, a leader of the Herero people, letter to another African leader, 
German South-West Africa, 1904. 

All our obedience and patience with the Germans is of little avail, for each day they shoot 
someone dead for no reason at all. Hence I appeal to you my Brother, not to hold aloof 
from the uprising, but to make your voice heard so that all Africa may take up arms against 
the Germans. Let us die fighting rather than die as a result of maltreatment, imprisonment, 
or some other calamity. Tell all the chiefs down there to rise and do battle.

Document 8 

Source:  German military officer, account of the 1905 Maji Maji Rebellion in German  
East Africa, German military weekly newspaper, 1906. 

The chiefs spread it among their people that a spirit, living in the form of a snake,  
had given a magic medicine to a medicine man. The medicine guaranteed a good harvest, 
so that in future people would no more need to perform wage labor for foreigners in order 
to obtain accustomed luxuries. The medicine would also give invulnerability, acting in 
such a way that enemy bullets would fall from their targets like raindrops from a greased 
body. It would strengthen women and children for the flight customary in wartime, with 
the associated hardships and privations, and protect them from being seized by the 
victorious attackers, who were accustomed to taking women and children with them as war 
prizes. The medicine consisted of water, maize, and sorghum grains. The water was 
applied by pouring it over the head and by drinking. 

Document 9 

Source:  Mojimba, African chief, describing a battle in 1877 on the Congo River against 
British and African mercenaries, as told to a German Catholic missionary in 1907. 

And still those bangs went on; the long sticks spat fire, pieces of iron whistled around us, 
fell into the water with a hissing sound, and our brothers continued to fall. We ran into our 
village and they ran after us. We fled into the forest and flung ourselves on the ground. 
When we returned that evening our eyes beheld fearful things:  our brothers, dead, 
bleeding, our village plundered and burned, and the river full of dead bodies. 

You call us wicked men, but you White men are much more wicked! You think because 
you have guns you can take away our land and our possessions. You have sickness in your 
heads, for this is not justice.
