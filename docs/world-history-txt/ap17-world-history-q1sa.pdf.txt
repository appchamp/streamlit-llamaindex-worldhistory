Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to parts (a) and (b) that would earn credit: 

•  The Chinese imperial state, from the Han to the Tang, and, to some extent the Song, as it sought to 
expand its empire, came into contact with nomadic peoples from whom they continued to demand 
tribute and submission. 

•  Nomadic peoples, because of their pastoral lifestyles, continued to rely on settled Chinese people 

for finished goods and products that they were unable to produce themselves. 

•  Chinese imperial power, both economic and military, forced nearby nomadic peoples to submit, 

kowtow, and give tribute to the Chinese state throughout the period from the Han to the Tang and, 
to some extent, the Song dynasty. 

•  The Chinese imperial belief in their own cultural superiority led them to consistently depict 

nomadic peoples as inferior and needing to submit. 

•  Respectful relationships, identified in the drawing, between nomads and the Chinese represented 

Confucian ideals that were a continuity in imperial China.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  The tributary system, used by previous dynasties to pacify Central Asian nomads, was reversed by 
officials during the Qing dynasty, who used conquest and governance to dominate this region. 
•  Mongolian nomads gained control over the Chinese imperial state rather than merely seeking trade 

opportunities, reversing the role they played in previous centuries. 

•  The Khitan and the Jurchen, unwilling to maintain the old tributary relationship with the Chinese 
imperial state, defeated the Song, conquered portions of northern China, and forced the Song to 
pay tribute and recognize their dynasties as equals.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 1 

Overview 

This question presented students with an image of a Chinese general of the Tang dynasty interacting with 
Uighur nomads on the frontier of China. The students were then asked to identify and explain two 
continuities in Chinese imperial history based on the interaction depicted in the image. Further, students 
were asked to identify and explain one way in which the interaction between imperial China and Central 
Asian nomads changed after 1100 C.E. This question tested students’ ability to demonstrate and apply 
their knowledge of interactions between Chinese and Central Asian peoples. Even though the image is 
rooted in the Tang dynasty period (618–907 C.E.), students could draw on their knowledge of interactions 
between Chinese and Central Asian nomads in earlier periods, such as under the Han dynasty, or in later 
periods, such as under the Song and Ming dynasties. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned the point because it identifies the tribute system and explains that the image 
illustrates how nomadic peoples would perform the kowtow to demonstrate their submission to Chinese 
power, often in exchange for gifts. 

b) The response earned the point because it explains that the image illustrates Chinese feelings of ethnic 
superiority by depicting the nomads (in “messy and ragged dress”) as inferior to the Chinese.  

c) The response earned the point because it explains that after 1100 C.E. nomadic invaders forced the 
Chinese Song dynasty to flee to the south and altered the tribute system by compelling the Song to provide 
lavish gifts in exchange for security. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 2 

a) The response did not earn the point because mentioning that there were “many interactions” between 
China and nomadic peoples is not sufficient to demonstrate an understanding of a continuity depicted in the 
image.  

b) Although the response inaccurately refers to the Uighurs as “civilians,” it earned the point because it 
addresses continuity by mentioning how the Uighurs’ submission to Guo Ziyi illustrates Confucian protocol 
in imperial China. 

c) The response earned the point because it addresses change over time by citing the Mongol invasions of 
China and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned the point because it explains how the image’s depiction of the Uighurs’ submission 
to the Tang general Guo Ziyi reflects Chinese feelings of cultural and ethnic superiority. 

b) The response did not earn the point because its claim that the Chinese and the nomads “continued to 
interact with hospitality” and “kindness” is a misinterpretation of the interaction portrayed in the image and 
not necessarily a continuity in Chinese imperial history. 

c) The response did not earn the point because the tribute system between China and Central Asian nomads 
was established well before 1100 C.E.
