Question 1 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1. Has acceptable thesis. 

0-7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address TWO RESPONSES to the spread of influenza in the 

early 20th century plausibly drawn from the documents.   

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or specified conclusion of 

the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple consecutive sentences. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count in any other category.  

2. Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

•  Students must address ALL NINE of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate an understanding of the basic meaning of AT LEAST 

EIGHT documents.  

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of a document by 

grouping it in regard to A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza.  

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without 

context does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  

1-2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza. Must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza. Must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of seven documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

4. Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 
Students must correctly analyze point of view in AT LEAST TWO documents.  

•  Point of view explains why this individual might have this opinion or what feature 

informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining a document’s tone, 
the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion (or some combination of these). 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, but 

they must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing 
some plausible analysis of how or why. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.
