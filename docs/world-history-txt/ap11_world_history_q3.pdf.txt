      For 1 point: 

•  Must provide at least four pieces of relevant and accurate evidence
•

2011 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

The intent of the question was for students to compare the rise of two of the following empires: a West 
African Sudanic empire (Mali, Ghana, or Songhay), the Aztec Empire, or the Mongol Empire. Students 
were explicitly instructed to choose two empires from the list and analyze both the similarities and the 
differences in their rise. One of the central questions of world history is: How similar and how different 
were historical changes in different parts of the world? For this reason, comparison is an important 
historical thinking skill emphasized in the AP World History course. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 8  

The essay contains a valid thesis in the last paragraph (1 point). The student earned 2 points for addressing 
the question but does so in different parts of the essay. In the first paragraph the student addresses 
difference in the rise of empires: “while the Mongols brutally attacked already established states, Mali arose 
by much more peaceful methods, although warfare did happen, and it arose from regional kingdoms.” The 
student addresses similarity in the rise of empires at the end of the third paragraph: “a similarity they shared 
was cultural growth in their rise of empire as a result of trade.” Throughout the essay the student provides 
ample evidence to support comparisons of the empires and provides evidence related to the rise of the 
Mongols in the second paragraph: “Under the lead of Genghis Khan, other civilizations experienced 
massacre and destruction” (2 points). The student makes several relevant, direct comparisons between 
empires (1 point). The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the reason for a similarity (that both 
empires practiced a measure of religious tolerance) at the end of the second paragraph (1 point). The essay 
contains multiple direct, relevant comparisons and sufficient depth of comparisons to earn 1 expanded core 
point. 

Sample: 3B  
Score: 6 

There is no valid thesis in the introductory paragraph, and the student does not write a concluding 
paragraph. The student states in the introduction that there are similarities and differences between the Mali 
and Aztec empires but does not identify any specific comparisons between the two in relation to their rise to 
power. In the three body paragraphs that follow, the student addresses each of the three areas of comparison 
identified in the introduction (“economics, politics and society”). In the third paragraph the student identifies 
a comparison in relation to the rise of empires and earned 2 points for addressing the question: “They ruled 
over large areas of land, and expanded using military. However, there are differences as to how and where 
they ruled.” Throughout the essay the student provides ample evidence to support comparisons of the 
empires. In the third paragraph the student provides evidence for both the Aztecs and Mali that supports the 
comparison that the empires were similar politically (related to their rise): “The Aztecs ruled using military 
authority, with the Emperor being all powerful. In the case of the Mali, rulers ruled through tribal leaders, and 
while Mansas (emperors) were all powerful, the type of government was considered a centralized feudal 
empire” (2 points). The student makes several relevant, direct comparisons between empires (1 point). At the 
end of the last paragraph the student identifies one similarity between empires: “Merchants also played a 
large role.” The student analyzes that similarity at the end of the essay: “In the Mali empire, emphasis was 
placed on the merchant class because of Islamic influences and the Gold and Salt trade. In the Aztec Empire, 
merchants were considered to be bringers of wealth.” The student earned 1 point for analysis of a reason for 
the difference within the more general similarity.

Question 3 (continued) 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 3  

There is no valid thesis in either the introductory or concluding paragraph. The student states that there are 
similarities and differences between the Mongol and Aztec empires in the introduction but does not identify 
specific comparisons between the two empires in relation to their rise to power. Similarly, in the last 
paragraph, the student does not specifically address comparisons between the two empires in relation to 
their rise. In the body paragraphs of the essay the student identifies similarities between the two empires 
and does not address difference. In the third paragraph the student implies a similarity between the two 
empires in relation to their rise to power: “Both were very violent and harsh towards the people they 
conquered.” As a result, the student earned 1 point for addressing part of the question. Additionally, in the 
body paragraphs of the essay, the student addresses each of the three areas of comparison identified in the 
introduction (“religion, trade, and views”). In doing so, the student provides four pieces of evidence; three  
in relation to the Aztecs and one in relation to the Mongols. However, none of this evidence is tied to 
comparisons about the rise of empires (1 point). Each direct comparison in the essay identifies 
characteristics of the empires in relation to religion, trade, and “views” of the people they conquered  
(1 point).
