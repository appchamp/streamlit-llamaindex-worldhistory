Student Performance Q&A: 

2008 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2008 free-response questions for AP® World History were 
written by the Chief Reader, Merry Wiesner-Hanks of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee; 
Sharon Cohen of Springbrook High School in Silver Spring, Maryland; Joseph (Jay) Harmon of 
Cypress Woods High School in Cypress, Texas; and Mee-Ae Kim of The College of Idaho in 
Caldwell, Idaho. They give an overview of each free-response question and of how students 
performed on the question, including typical student errors. General comments regarding the 
skills and content that students frequently have the most problems with are included. Some 
suggestions for improving student performance in these areas are also provided. Teachers are 
encouraged to attend a College Board workshop to learn strategies for improving student 
performance in specific areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

For the document-based question, students were expected to analyze factors that shaped the 
modern Olympic movement in the context of major events in the twentieth century.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score of 2.03 out of a possible 9 points was dramatically lower than in the two previous 
years. The mean score in 2007 was 2.84; in 2006, 3.27.  

The primary reason for the low score was that many students did not answer the question that had 
been asked and instead inverted it; that is, they answered a question about the effects of the 
Olympics on the twentieth century. On the positive side, a majority of the essays provided a thesis 
listing two or more factors that shaped the modern Olympic movement. Many essays addressed all 
10 documents and showed understanding of the meaning of 9 documents. Most essays included 
multiple groupings of the 10 sources; the common groupings were political (nationalism), economic 
(commercialism), and social (feminism), but students also used other types of groupings that 
helped to answer the question. They were particularly effective in connecting the Olympics with 
nationalism. Unsurprisingly, most students showed a familiarity with the modern Olympic 
movement from 1892 to 2002, although their background knowledge sometimes contributed to 
lengthy answers that did not address the question effectively.

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Many students did not answer the question actually asked about the “factors that shaped the 
modern Olympic movement” but instead addressed the inverse of that question and described the 
effects of the Olympics on society. In many of the essays, students also did not seem to be aware 
that they had shifted to using the documents as evidence to answer the inverse of the question, 
which made it impossible for them to earn any evidence points. For example, some used evidence 
from the documents to address how the Olympics caused nationalism or feminism rather than how 
the Olympics were shaped or affected by these global processes. In addition, many students merely 
discussed individual documents as they related to the general topic of the Olympics instead of 
using them as evidence to analyze factors that shaped the modern Olympic movement.  

Surprisingly, students showed misunderstanding of some documents, perhaps because they did 
not read the dates when the documents had been created. For example, many students claimed 
that document 3, the 1956 memoir of a British Olympic official about the actions of the Nazi ski 
team at the 1936 games, was created during the time of declared hostilities between Germany and 
Great Britain in the Second World War.  

Students may have read the documents too quickly as well. For example, many students showed 
misunderstanding of the graph in document 9. The graph explicitly states that it shows “fees paid 
to the International Olympic Committee for international TV and radio broadcast rights.” Instead, 
students interpreted it as representing the amount of advertising sold. Many students also read the 
documents literally and did not think about them. For example, they merely repeated the words in 
document 6, the 1980 Soviet Olympic Organizing Committee press release, about the Soviet Union 
being “a beacon of peace, democracy, and social progress.”  

Many students did not explicitly group the documents. They often discussed two documents 
sequentially that could indeed be grouped (such as documents 2 and 8, both of which include 
information about women’s participation in the Olympics) but then did not include any sort of 
topical or linking sentence that explained how the two were related.  

This year, there again was little analysis of point of view, which was required for only two 
documents. When students did attempt to analyze point of view, the analysis was often wrong or 
incompletely explained. Some essays merely stated erroneously that it was “obvious” what the 
point of view was due to the gender or nationality of the author. Statistics were not questioned but 
assumed to be accurate.  

Many students also did not attempt to identify and explain why an additional document would help 
assess the factors shaping the modern Olympics. When students did identify an additional 
document, the explanation was vague or not tied to factors affecting the Olympics.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam? 

Teachers should emphasize the importance of answering the question that is on the exam, not a 
different question created by the student. They should give students practice reading the 
directions that precede the question, show students how the directions relate to each point of the

scoring guidelines, and guide students in outlining the steps for analyzing and answering the 
question.  

In general, students need practice with reading primary sources and graphs carefully to 
understand the meaning of the source in its historical context. Teachers should help students see 
how the historical context provided in the attribution line or internally within the text of the 
document will help them understand the meaning and point of view in the document. Students 
should be given practice in distinguishing between a summary of the documents and an 
explanation of the documents’ meaning, the “so what?” question.  

Students continue to view the word “bias” as invariably reflecting something negative, so it would 
be helpful to avoid that word completely and use “perspective” or “point of view” when teaching 
students how to analyze tone or other aspects of the documents. Students also need to practice 
analyzing visuals like photographs and finding point of view in them. The analysis of point of view 
often works best when integrated into the analysis of the document for evidence to support the 
thesis, not tacked on as a separate issue toward the end of the essay.  

All of the sources printed in the exam booklet for the document-based question were chosen to 
provide evidence to answer the question; therefore, all of the documents had to be addressed and 
analyzed, not just quoted. Encourage students to cite the document number when quoting from a 
document in their essays. Teachers could let students apply the scoring guidelines to sample 
essays to see how essays with “good writing” score low if analysis of the documents is incomplete.  

Although specific outside knowledge is not required to answer the document-based question, 
students should be encouraged to link the world history themes they have learned in the course, to 
provide historical context for their primary source analysis. This does not, however, mean that 
students should be encouraged to throw in everything they know about the topic. To this end, 
teachers can use the sample essays to help students see how those essays that received a high 
score give only background historical information that is pertinent to the question.  

Teachers should discourage students from requesting the additional document at the end of the 
essay, because the conclusion might need to stand in for the essay’s thesis if the thesis at the 
beginning is inadequate. If the last paragraph is devoted to the request for an additional document 
and an explanation of its usefulness, the student may miss a second chance to earn the thesis 
point. For the additional document, formulaic requests do not work; asking for a female or a lower-
class perspective, for example, without explaining how that additional perspective could help 
answer the question and/or contribute to the analysis of the other documents does not show a 
student’s mastery of this skill. The rationale or justification for the requested additional document 
must relate back to the question.  

Teachers could work with colleagues in the English department to teach students vocabulary that 
helps demonstrate analysis of the documents and supplies transitions in the argumentation of the 
essay (e.g., terms such as “evidence,” “affirm,” “credit,” and “discredit”). Students could be shown 
how topic sentences can be used to justify groupings and to relate evidence to the thesis, and also 
how closing sentences can be used to explain how the documents help to answer the question.

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

The continuity and change-over-time question asked: “Analyze the changes and continuities in 
commerce in the Indian Ocean region from 650 C.E. to 1750 C.E.” The intent of this question was to 
have students explain the reasons for the changes and continuities in commerce in the Indian 
Ocean region during those 1100 years. The focus of the question, Indian Ocean trade in that time 
period, is a “mainstream” topic in the AP World History course.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score for this question was 2.6 out of a possible 9 points, significantly higher than it had 
been last year, though lower than in 2006. The mean score in 2007 was 1.45; in 2006, 3.02.  

Students who understood the purpose of the question generally did well on the essay, and many 
students had a large amount of factual knowledge. They knew something about the commodities 
traded, especially spices, and something about the technology of commerce, including ships. They 
also had a basic knowledge of the geography of the area, which was very encouraging. Many 
included information about the spread of Islam and about Zheng He’s voyages. Many mentioned 
the first European voyages to the region. Better essays were quite sophisticated in their handling 
of the question, and they showed an ability to address issues of causation. The better essays also 
addressed the issue of continuity more fully than those in years past and linked the continuities 
discussed more clearly with the issue of commerce, rather than just mentioning them. For example, 
good essays did not simply say that the spread of Islam was a continuity but explained “why” in 
their discussion of the role of Muslim merchants. Thus, many students appeared to be better 
trained in analysis, for which teachers should be commended. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

The most common error was not providing a thesis that fully addressed the question or writing a 
thesis that simply restated the question; “There were many changes and continuities in commerce 
in the Indian Ocean region from 650 to 1750” was not an acceptable thesis. As in previous years, to 
receive the thesis point, a student’s thesis needed to address both changes and continuities. In 
many cases, students attempted a thesis that addressed only changes but not continuities, such 
as: “There were many changes in the technology and participants in commerce in the Indian 
Ocean trade.” An acceptable thesis included both: “There were changes in technology and the 
participants in commerce but continuities in some of the materials traded in the Indian Ocean 
region from 650 to 1750.” 

Another frequent error was that students provided snapshots of items exchanged in the Indian 
Ocean region in this era, or of the participants in merchant activity, without noting whether these 
were an example of change or of continuity. They thus listed facts without using them as specific 
evidence to support the overall argument of the thesis. 

Students also had difficulty viewing the developments in the Indian Ocean region that they 
discussed as a process, and many did not attempt any analysis at all. Those who did attempt 
analysis sometimes tried to fit their evidence into a formulaic “beginning, middle, end” pattern that

did not work well with this year’s question and often kept them from seeing or analyzing 
continuities. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

Teachers should emphasize that the continuity and change-over-time question is indeed about 
changes and continuities. Many essays addressed only changes, despite the explicit directions 
both in the question and in the bulleted directions above the question in the exam booklet. 
Because students still struggle with continuity, teachers need to present models for analyzing this, 
both within specific time periods and across very long periods. To do this, teachers will have to 
step beyond the textbook, since most textbooks do not address issues of long-term continuities 
very well.  

Those who are still teaching their students a “beginning, middle, end” formula for writing 
continuity and change-over-time essays should stop doing so. Snapshots of history at the 
beginning, middle, and end of a given time period do not address the process of change or 
encourage students to analyze the reasons for those processes; such a formula also works against 
encouraging students’ ability to address continuities. 

Teachers should develop students’ skills in writing theses that address all parts of the question and 
attain a level of specificity. Students need more training in historical-thinking skills. They need to 
be able to recognize the task in the question that has been asked (in this case, “analyze”) and 
present an argument that answers the essay with specific evidence. This year students included a 
comparatively large amount of specific evidence when answering the question, but fewer were 
able to demonstrate how that evidence linked with historical processes. 

Question 3 

What was the intent of this question? 

The comparative question asked: Compare the emergence of nation-states in nineteenth-century 
Latin America with the emergence of nation-states in ONE of the following regions in the 
twentieth century.  

Sub-Saharan Africa  
The Middle East 

The question directed students to compare the emergence of the nation-states, not to compare 
long-term nation building. Many students focused on the latter. 

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score for this question was 1.2, significantly lower than it has ever been. The mean score 
in 2007 was a relatively high 2.99; in 2006, it was 2.6.  

In part, the low score was because a very large percentage of students did not answer, wrote off-
topic responses, or merely paraphrased the question. (More than half of the students received a 
score of 0 or did not attempt to answer this question.) Students who made a reasonable attempt to 
answer the question seemed to understand that the essay had to provide both similarities and

differences between Latin America and either the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, 
many students effectively demonstrated basic knowledge of the regions. Of the three regions, 
students tended to do best in understanding nineteenth-century Latin America. Many linked 
European Enlightenment ideas and the French Revolution to the Haitian Revolution and 
independence movements in mainland Latin America. 

The basic core scoring guidelines had five components: (1) the thesis had to address explicitly a 
similarity or a difference in the emergence of nation-states in Latin America with the emergence of 
nation-states in either the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa; (2) students had to address both 
similarities and differences for the two regions; (3) evidence for both regions supporting the 
emergence of nation-states was required; (4) students were to provide a direct comparison of the 
process of nation building; and (5) students were instructed to analyze a reason for a similarity or a 
difference between the two regions. Students who successfully fulfilled these core points became 
eligible for up to 2 expanded points by writing an essay that exceeded the requirements of the core 
points in one or more ways. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Although students who made a reasonable attempt to write the essay had a general grasp of the 
issues, they were hindered by a lack of clarity concerning emerging nation-states and the 
differences in centuries, nineteenth for Latin America and twentieth for the Middle East and sub-
Saharan Africa. Students generally attempted to address both similarities and differences in their 
thesis; most tended to do well in providing either similarities or differences, but rarely both. Many 
were also confused about terminology: “nation-state,” “nationalism,” “colonialism,” “imperialism,” 
and “decolonization” were often poorly understood. 

Students tended to struggle with the complexities of twentieth-century Middle East and sub-
Saharan Africa. In addition, students often made vague generalizations about entire regions 
without offering specific supporting evidence. Some students focused on social, political, and 
economic categories without adequately providing factual information that supported the use of 
these categories in comparing emerging nation-states. While this model can be effective, it is 
inappropriate without supporting evidence. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message 
would you like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of 
their students on the exam?  

This year an acceptable thesis could address either similarity or difference; but the trend has 
generally favored a thesis that addresses both, and teachers and students should be prepared to 
include both. For students to receive credit for a direct comparison, they had to provide specific 
examples and not vague or generic generalizations. For students to receive credit for analysis, they  
had to explain the causes of similarities and differences. Students need training in thinking and 
writing about comparisons that tackle complicated and challenging concepts. In addition, students 
seem unprepared to present factual evidence, particularly from the twentieth century. 

Given the huge number of students who made no attempt to answer the question, it is important 
to note that teachers need to help students manage their time more effectively. Students can 
benefit from practice with writing timed essays when they do not know the subject of the question 
ahead of time.
