Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying one way in which subsistence patterns pre-dating the Neolithic Revolution 

continued among some Eurasian societies in the period circa 10,000 B.C.E. to 3,000 B.C.E. 

•  ONE point for identifying one way in which the Neolithic Revolution changed Eurasian societies’ 

subsistence patterns in the period circa 10,000 B.C.E. to 3,000 B.C.E. 

•  ONE point for explaining one way in which changes in Eurasian societies’ subsistence patterns altered 

their political or social structures in the period circa 10,000 B.C.E. to 600 B.C.E. 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  People in Eurasian societies continued to hunt, fish, and gather. 
•  People continued to select certain plants and animals for human use. 
•  Seasonal migrations in search of food continued among some Eurasian peoples after the Neolithic 

Revolution.

Short Answer Question 3 (continued) 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  After the Neolithic Revolution people began to practice agriculture. 
•  Some Eurasian societies began to practice nomadic pastoralism following the Neolithic Revolution. 
•  The Neolithic Revolution provided Eurasian societies with better tools with which to cultivate the land, 

harvest crops, and hunt.  

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Eurasian social structures changed in the Neolithic era as social hierarchies became more complex or 

patriarchal because of agriculture.  

•  The development of agriculture in Eurasia led to the creation of states, public works, or law codes 

because agriculture allowed societies to acquire surpluses that needed to be managed and protected. 

•  The emergence of agriculture following the Neolithic Revolution led to great increases in human 

populations because people could stay in one place, generate surpluses, and create more complex 
hierarchies based on social class or political power.

2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 3 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify changes and continuities in subsistence 
patterns in Eurasian societies both before and after the Neolithic Revolution. Students first had to identify a 
subsistence pattern pre-dating the Neolithic Revolution that continued in the period circa 10,000 B.C.E. to   
3,000 B.C.E. Next, students had to identify one way in which the Neolithic Revolution changed Eurasian 
subsistence patterns in the same period. Lastly, students had to explain how these changes in subsistence 
patterns altered a political or social structure in Eurasian society. The question addressed Key Concepts 1.1 
and 1.2 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skill of Continuity and 
Change. 

Sample: 3A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies hunting and gathering as practices that continued into the 

Neolithic period. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the domestication of plants and animals as a change in 

subsistence patterns that took place during the Neolithic period. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains how patriarchal societies developed because of the 

emergence of agricultural societies. 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 2 

a) The response did not earn the point because it incorrectly identifies patriarchal social systems as a 

subsistence pattern. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the development of agriculture as a change in subsistence 

patterns. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that agriculture promoted the development of social 

stratification. 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because the development of the “Indus valley river civilizations” is not a 

continuity in subsistence patterns from before the Neolithic Revolution. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it identifies growing new crops as a change in subsistence patterns 

that occurred because of the Neolithic Revolution. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it does not sufficiently explain how the establishment of a “new 

type of government in Eurasia” was a result of changes in subsistence patterns.
