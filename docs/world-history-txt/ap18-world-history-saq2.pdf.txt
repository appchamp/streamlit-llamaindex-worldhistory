Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  The event depicted in the image reflects the growing power of European states and the decline of some 

Asian empires. 

•  The event depicted in the image reflects the disintegration of the Mughal Empire and the beginning of 
the British conquest of India, eventually allowing Great Britain to become the world’s greatest global 
power. 

•  The Mughal emperor’s granting of concessions to the British East India Company reflects the ways in 
which some European joint-stock companies contributed to expanding European power across the 
world while weakening Asian states. 

•  The Mughal Empire’s grant of the tax revenues to Great Britain, as shown in the image, was ultimately 
the result of Great Britain defeating European rivals such as France and the Netherlands to become the 
dominant power in South Asia. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  The event shown in the image reflects the growing power of European merchants and companies over 

trade and commerce in Asia.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued) 

•  The event shown in the image illustrates how Europeans were able to use their economic power 

through joint-stock companies, such as the British EIC, to weaken Asian states.  

•  The Mughal grant shows how competition between European mercantilist states and companies 

weakened Asian states by allowing Europeans to gain greater access to and control over Asian 
markets. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  The most significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and South Asia from the time of 
the image to the nineteenth century is that the image shows only the beginning of the British conquest 
of India, whereas the British gained total control over India in the nineteenth century. 

•  A significant way that the relationship between Great Britain and India changed in the nineteenth 

century is that the cooperation between the Mughals and the British shown in the image turned into 
resistance and repression as Britain crushed the great Indian rebellion (or Sepoy Mutiny) of 1857. 
•  The most significant change is that Britain gained greater power in India, which led to the collapse of 

the Indian textile industry, the spread of famine, and India’s impoverishment.

2018 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 2 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to identify how Mughal tax concessions to the British 
East India Company (EIC), as illustrated in an engraving by Benjamin West that depicts Robert Clive of the 
EIC receiving the right to tax three provinces from the Mughal emperor Shah ‘Alam II, reflected political 
changes in the global balance of power in the eighteenth century. Furthermore, students were expected to 
explain how the same image reflected economic changes in Asia in the same century. Finally, students were 
asked to explain how Great Britain’s relationship with South Asia in the nineteenth century changed from the 
relationship depicted in the image. The question addressed Key Concepts 4.3 and 5.2 in the AP World History 
Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of Continuity and Change over Time and 
Contextualization. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies how the greater political power of European trading 

companies, such as those of the British and Dutch, in Asia reflected political changes in the global balance 
of power in the eighteenth century. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that European companies gained greater control over 

economic production in Asia, which led to a decline in revenue for Asian empires. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that the British acquired complete control over India and 

made it “the crown jewel in their empire.” 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because it accurately identifies how the image reflects a shift in the global 

balance of political power by mentioning that the power of land-based empires decreased while the power of 
“sea trade empires” and joint-stock companies increased. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains how the image reflects economic changes in Asia through 
its discussion of the British and Dutch increasingly monopolizing trade and production in India and the 
Spice Islands, which led to the decline of “Asian colonies.” 

c) The response did not earn the point because it does not explain a change in the relationship between Great 

Britain and South Asia. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because its assertion that granting the British the right to collect taxes 

in three Indian provinces strengthened the Mughal Empire does not accurately identify a political change in 
the global balance of power as reflected in the image.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued)  

b) The response did not earn the point because its assertion that the Mughals’ tax concessions to the British 

made the empire stronger and wealthier does not accurately explain an economic change in Asia as 
reflected in the image. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that the relationship between Great Britain and South Asia 
changed in the nineteenth century from wealth accumulation to colonization (“Britain completely owned 
India”).
