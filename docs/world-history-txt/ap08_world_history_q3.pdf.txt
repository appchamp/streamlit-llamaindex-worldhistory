Question 3—Comparative  

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1.  Has acceptable thesis. 

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address EITHER similarities OR differences in the emergence of  
nation-states in nineteenth-century Latin America AND that of nation-states in  
EITHER sub-Saharan Africa OR the Middle East in the twentieth century. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the conclusion of the essay. 
•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs or merely restates the prompt is  

unacceptable. For example, “There were many similarities and differences . . .” is not acceptable.

thoroughly. 

2 Points 

•  Students may use one or more countries per region as examples. 
•  Students may discuss specifics about a region without mentioning a particular nation-state. 
•  The essay must focus on emerging nation-states, but discussion may include nation-building. 
•  Students need not cover the entire time period but should compare relevant time periods. 
•  For Latin America, students may write about the long nineteenth century (1750–1914). 
•  The twentieth century is 1901–2000. 

 For 2 points: 

•  BOTH a similarity AND a difference in the emergence of nation-states in the TWO regions are 

addressed. 
 For 1 point: 

•  EITHER a similarity OR difference in the emergence of nation-states in the TWO  

regions is addressed. 

3.   Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 

2 Points 

 For 2 points: 

•  Provides at least four pieces of specific evidence that support the emergence of  

nation-states with at least ONE example from EACH region. 
 For 1 point: 

•  Provides at least three pieces of specific evidence that support the emergence of  

nation-states with at least ONE example from EACH region. 

4.  Makes at least one direct comparison between or among societies.  

1 Point 

•  Makes at lease ONE direct, relevant, and factually correct comparison between  

the regions about the emergence of nation-states. 

5.   Analyzes at least one reason for a similarity or difference identified in  

a direct comparison. 

•  Analyzes at least ONE relevant reason for a similarity or a difference between the  

regions concerning the emergence of nation-states.

2008 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3—Comparative 

Overview 

The comparative question asked: “Compare the emergence of nation-states in nineteenth-century Latin 
America with the emergence of nation-states in ONE of the following regions in the twentieth century.  

Sub-Saharan Africa  
The Middle East” 

The question directed students to compare the emergence of the nation-states, not to compare long-term 
nation-building. Many students focused on the latter.  

Sample: 3A 
Score: 9 

The thesis is the last sentence of the first paragraph, and it addresses both similarity and difference (1 point). 
Similarities and differences are considered throughout the essay (2 points). The student provides rich 
evidence for both Latin America and the Middle East (2 points). A direct comparison of a similarity occurs at 
the beginning of the second paragraph and in other places as well (1 point). The student analyzes reasons 
for similarities and differences in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs for both Latin America and the 
Middle East (1 point). In addition to substantial evidence throughout the essay, the analysis of reasons for 
similarities and differences is extensive and of high quality (2 points). 

Sample: 3B 
Score: 5 

While a thesis is attempted in the first paragraph, it is too vague and thus inadequate. The concluding 
paragraph does not include an adequate thesis either. A similarity (in the second paragraph) focuses on the 
break from “European colonial domination” in both Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa (1 point). An 
attempt is made to delineate a difference in the fourth paragraph, but it is uneven and vague and thus not 
acceptable. Although some of the evidence is concerned with nation-building as opposed to the emergence 
of nation-states, there is enough relevant evidence for both Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa (2 points). 
Direct comparisons are discussed in the second and third paragraphs (1 point). The student analyzes 
similarities in the third paragraph (1 point). 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 2 

A thesis is attempted at the beginning of the essay, but it does not address the question and is therefore 
unacceptable. The student does not provide a suitable similarity or difference. There are two pieces of 
evidence that support the emergence of nation-states in Latin America and two pieces of evidence that 
support the emergence of nation-states in sub-Saharan Africa (2 points). No acceptable direct comparison 
of the emergence process in the two regions is included, and the student does not analyze a reason for a 
similarity or a difference.
