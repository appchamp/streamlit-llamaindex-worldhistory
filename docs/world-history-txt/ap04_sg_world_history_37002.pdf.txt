Question 1—Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence): 

1.   Has acceptable thesis. 

0-7 Points 

1 Point 

Thesis must be located at the beginning (introduction) or the end (conclusion) of the essay.  No split 
thesis; although it may be 2 connected sentences.  Thesis must include specific references to different 
types of responses.  Examples include: 

•  There were positive and negative responses (minimally acceptable). 
•  Change over Time: there were more positive responses early in the period than later. 
•  Buddhism more acceptable in times of disorder; Confucianism more acceptable in stable times. 
•  Blending: positive, negative, and some advocated blending or coexistence of religions/philosophies.  

“There were many responses,” without qualification, is not sufficient as a thesis. 

2.   Uses 6 or 5, of the 6 documents. 

1 Point 
There are 6 documents.  Students must make use of 6 or 5 documents.  It is not sufficient to mention a 
document in a list. 

3.   Understands the basic meaning of documents cited in the essay. 

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
Students must understand the basic meaning of 4 of 5 or 5 of 6 documents. 
•  #3 is frequently misinterpreted as being hostile to Buddhism. 
• 

If the typographical error on the date in Document 1 is the root of a misinterpretation, it does 
not count against the student (e.g., if Buddha is used with a C.E. date, instead of B.C.E. date). 

4.   Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from the documents. 

1 Point 

•  For 3 documents, students support thesis by analyzing documents: why a document is 

significant or how it supports their thesis (analysis, not “plot summary”). 

•  This may be in the form of student commentary on concrete details, or the application of 

documents to the student’s argument. 

5.   Analyzes bias or point of view (POV) in three documents. 

Students must analyze POV correctly in 3 documents.  

1 Point 

•  POV explains why this particular person might have this particular opinion or what informs the 
author’s POV.  Students must consider the characteristics of the author, and/or the intended 
audience, and/or the form or medium (official documents, sermon, etc.), and/or the tone of the 
document, and/or how the temporal context (e.g., writing in a period of stability/instability) 
may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying/repeating source information verbatim 

from the documents.

Question 1—Document-Based Question (cont’d.) 

6.   Analyzes the documents by grouping them in at least two ways. 

1 Point 

•  Positive responses: (1), 2, 3, 5 
•  Negative responses: 4, 6 
•  Responses during upheaval (pre-Tang): (1), 2, 3 
• 
•  Universalist, individualistic, blending, inclusionary responses: (1), 2, 3, 5 

“Traditional Confucian,” xenophobic, historical responses: 4, 6 with evidence from 3, 5 

7.   Identifies one type of appropriate additional document. 

1 Point 

Students must identify an additional document or type of document and explain why that document is 
appropriate for their argument.  The mostly commonly called-for documents are: 

lower class documents (peasant, farmer, merchant) to show contrast with the elite documents; 

• 
•  women’s voices to contrast with the male elite documents; 
•  chart, graph, or map showing populations of Buddhist converts over time.
