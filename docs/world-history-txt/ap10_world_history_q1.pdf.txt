Question 1 — Document-Based Question 

BASIC CORE (competence)   

1.  Has acceptable thesis.   

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must explicitly state at least one similarity and one difference in the 

characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton industry in Japan and India as 
evidenced in the documents. 

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified conclusion 

of the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs is unacceptable. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  Thesis statements such as “there were more similarities than differences” are not   

acceptable. 

•  The thesis CANNOT count for any other point. 

2.  Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

(May misinterpret one document.) 
•  Students must address all 10
•  Students must demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of 

 of the documents. 

at least nine

documents. 

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of a document by 

grouping it in regard to a specified characteristic of the mechanization of the cotton 
industry. 

•  Restating or quoting the content of the documents separately does not adequately 

demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3.  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the 
 documents. 

cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of nine

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

      For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of a characteristic of the mechanization of the 
 documents. 

cotton industry must be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight

•  A document that is simply listed cannot count as evidence. 

4.  Analyzes point of view in at least two documents.  

•  Students must correctly analyze point of view in at least two

 documents. 

1 Point 

o  Point of view explains why this particular person might have this particular 

opinion or what particular feature informs the author’s point of view. 

o  Students must move beyond mere description by identifying a plausible tone, 
the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, and/or how the 
intended outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion. 

o  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view but 
must move beyond a mere statement of “bias” by providing some plausible 
analysis. 

o  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.

it. 

•  No comparison within the paragraph or thesis is necessary to earn the grouping 

point.

AP® WORLD HISTORY 
2010 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

The intent of the question was to compare the characteristics of the mechanization of the cotton textile 
industry in Japan and India during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Unlike most recent document-
based questions (DBQs), these documents could not simply be classified in one category for analysis. 
Many of the 10 documents had internal evidence that represented multiple characteristics of 
mechanization. Given the richness and diversity of the sources, students could use individual documents 
in a variety of ways to represent different characteristics of mechanization in India and Japan and to 
provide multiple differences and similarities between the two. Documents could be grouped in a variety of 
ways: for example, in terms of growth in production, gender of the labor forces, traditional forms of 
production, and labor conditions in both India and Japan. 

Attribution for the individual documents was clear and provided ample opportunities for discussion of 
point of view and analysis of potential additional documents and sources.  

Readers were enthusiastic in their view that this was an exemplary DBQ in terms of both the question and 
the ease and reliability of applying the scoring guidelines. Students were given the opportunity to 
construct arguments in myriad ways, with evidence found internally within the same document(s). The 
question was very efficiently and accurately scored. 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 8 

The essay earned all of the Basic Core points and an additional point from the Expanded Core. The thesis is 
in the introduction and clearly makes a case for a similarity as well as differences in the characteristics of 
mechanization of the cotton industry in India and Japan (1 point). All of the documents are understood (1 
point) and are used for evidence (2 points). Points of view of the sources are provided for Documents 6 and 9, 
although 9 is marginally acceptable when the student discusses the veracity of the British commissioner (1 
point). The essay successfully groups the documents in five ways: production (Documents 1, 2 and 6), men 
(Documents 8 and 10), women in Japan (Documents 4 and 7), peasant origins of workers (Documents 4, 5 and 
9), and conditions of labor (Documents 3 and 9) (1 point). The student asks for three excellent additional 
documents: a document separating the Japanese hand- and machine-spun yarns for a better comparison 
with India, a report from an Indian worker, and a comparison of the actual machines used (1 point). The 
essay earned a point in the Expanded Core for a consistent comparison throughout, multiple additional 
documents, and a consistent utilization of the documents as evidence of the characteristics of 
mechanization of the cotton industry. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 6 

The essay earned 6 Basic Core points. There is an attempted thesis in both the introduction and the 
conclusion, but it is not successful because it does not provide any explicit differences. All of the documents 
are understood (1 point) and used for evidence (2 points). The essay provides a strong analysis of point of 
view for the source of Document 6 and a weaker but acceptable discussion of point of view for the source of 
Document 5 (1 point). The documents are successfully grouped in three ways: growth (Documents 1, 2 and 
6), migration from rural to urban areas (Documents 5, 8 and 9) and women (Documents 3, 4, 7 and 10) (1 
point). The student successfully asks for an additional document directly comparing traditional and 
mechanized systems of cotton production in order to address the reasons for the mechanization of cotton

Question 1 (continued) 

production. In addition, the student notes the lack of a document about trade relations or about the global 
context for these changes (1 point). 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 2 

The essay earned 2 Basic Core points. The thesis is in the first paragraph of the essay with a clearly defined 
similarity and difference (1 point). China is mistakenly identified in the introduction instead of Japan, but 
this error is later corrected; this can be overlooked within the “asset model” of scoring. The essay addresses 
seven of the 10 documents but does not address Documents 7, 8 or 10. The seven documents that are 
addressed are successfully used as evidence but did not meet the criteria for the evidence point which 
required a minimum of eight documents. The essay does not address the points of view for the sources of the 
documents. The seven documents are successfully grouped in three ways: production (Documents 1 and 2), 
conditions of labor (Documents 3, 4 and 9) and peasant laborers (Documents 5 and 9) (1 point). There is no 
attempt at identifying and explaining the need for an additional document.
