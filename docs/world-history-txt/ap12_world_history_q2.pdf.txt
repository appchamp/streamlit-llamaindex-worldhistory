2012 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to identify and analyze continuity and change in trade 
networks between Africa and Eurasia during the time period circa 300 C.E. to 1450 C.E. Students were also 
expected to provide historical evidence to support a discussion of change and continuity in trade networks 
between the two regions and to explain change and continuity within a world historical context. 

The AP World History course is designed to support student learning of four key historical thinking skills, 
one of which is “the ability to recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and 
change over periods of time of varying length, as well as relating these patterns to larger historical 
processes or themes.” Additionally, AP World History is anchored by five course themes. Although this 
question aligns with many of them, it is explicitly aligned with Theme 4: Creation, Expansion, and 
Interaction of Economic Systems. This question provided an opportunity for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of historical content and the application of historical thinking skills.  

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The student introduces a valid thesis in the first paragraph (1 point), and the essay as a whole addresses 
continuity and change (2 points). Both are mentioned in the middle of the second paragraph: “This changed 
as time went on” and “This continued from the 800s to circa the late 1300s.” The essay contains seven 
specific, accurate pieces of evidence in the second paragraph that support the discussion of changes in trade 
between Africa and Eurasia (2 points). The student uses relevant world historical context to explain change 
over time twice in the second paragraph (1 point). The essay contains multiple analyses of change in trade 
networks between Africa and Eurasia in the second paragraph (1 point). Overall, it meets all the criteria for 
the basic core points and demonstrates, with ample evidence, understanding of the complexity of changes 
and continuities in trade networks between the two regions; for these reasons, the essay earned  
1 expanded core point. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The essay contains a valid thesis in the last paragraph (1 point) and addresses continuity and change 
throughout (2 points). Continuity is discussed in the beginning of the second paragraph: “The items that 
were being traded between the regions never did change.” Change is considered in the beginning of the 
third paragraph: “Cultural interactions changed very much betwee [sic] the areas over the years.” The 
student offers four specific pieces of evidence: two support the discussion of changes in trade between Africa 
and Eurasia, and two support the discussion of continuities (1 point). The evidence of continuity is contained 
in the second paragraph: “Africa had vast amounts of luxury goods” and “Eurasia had vast amounts of 
wealth.” The evidence of change is contained in the third paragraph: “Trading posts were established,” and 
“[e]ven language began to mix.” The mention of Ibn Batuta in the third paragraph was not considered 
appropriate historical evidence in relation to this question, because it lacks any connection to trade. The 
student does not make effective use of relevant world historical context to explain continuity and/or change 
over time in the specified time period, nor does the student analyze either continuity or change in trade 
networks between Africa and Eurasia during that time period.

Question 2 (continued) 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

The essay does not contain a valid thesis, although the student does address change and continuity  
(2 points). Change is addressed in the beginning of the first paragraph: “A change in the trade networks was 
the way that things traveled and were delivered and the items traded.” Continuity is addressed in the fourth 
paragraph: “So, networks from Africa to Eurasia stayed the same in this time by continuing to trade for the 
same reasons.” The essay does not contain specific appropriate historical evidence in relation to the 
question, an effective use of relevant world historical context to explain continuity and/or change over time in 
the specified time period, nor an analysis of continuity and/or change in trade networks between Africa and 
Eurasia during the time.
