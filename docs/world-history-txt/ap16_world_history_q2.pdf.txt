Question 2 

Overview 

This question asked students to analyze economic continuities and changes in trade networks within 
Afro-Eurasia in the period circa 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. This content is part of Key Concept 3.1. of the AP 
World History Curriculum Framework, Expansion and Intensification of Communication and Exchange 
Networks. The geographic focus of the question was on the entirety of Afro-Eurasia, giving students broad 
scope to use examples drawn from various states and localities, such as the Sudanic empires, Islamic 
caliphates, Byzantine and other Roman successor states, South Asian principalities, several major Chinese 
dynasties, etc. The concept of the continuity-and-change-over-time question type is to require students to 
trace historical developments related to a particular topic through time, explaining reasons for continuity 
and change, and placing the continuities and changes in a broader world context. For this particular 
question, the intent of the wording was to narrow the focus to economic continuities and changes and to 
de-emphasize social, political, cultural, and environmental themes, in favor of the economic theme. In 
practice that meant that the focus of the question was on trade itself and on features of the trade networks 
that were directly linked to the economics of trade — for example, the types of goods and services 
exchanged, the geographic extent of the networks, and the organizational, logistical, infrastructural, or 
financial aspects of the trade carried along the networks. However, at the upper end of the score scale, 
some discussion of social, political, or other factors that influenced the process of trade route expansion 
and contraction was expected for essays to earn the point for analyzing the causes of continuity and 
change. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 9 

The essay includes a thesis in the first paragraph, and earned the thesis point. In the first body paragraph 
(pages 1–2), the essay addresses a continuity (continued use of the Silk Roads), then addresses and analyzes 
a change (the impact of the Mongol conquests on Silk Road trade), and, finally, shifts back to provide an 
analysis of the continuity (the role of large empires in maintaining commercial stability along the Silk Roads). 
The essay then proceeds (on pages 2–3) to address and analyze four additional economic changes: 
technological innovations that contributed to the growth in trade, increased volume in trans-Saharan trade, 
the development of financial mechanisms to support long-distance trade, and government support for 
merchants. The coherent discussion and analysis of both a continuity and multiple changes earned the essay 
2 points for addressing all parts of the question and 1 point for analyzing the process of continuity and 
change. The essay substantiates the thesis with over 20 pieces of relevant historical evidence, which earned 
2 points for evidence support. World Historical/Global context is successfully deployed to explain an 
economic change at the bottom of page 2, where the collapse of the Roman Empire is used as a factor in the 
analysis of the expanding volume of trans-Saharan trade. This earned the essay 1 point for using relevant 
context to explain continuity or change. In addition to earning all 7 points in the Basic Core, the essay earned 
the maximum 2 points in the Expanded Core for the wealth of analysis and evidence provided, as well as for 
the seamless way that evidence and analysis are integrated in a complex and nuanced overall argument. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The attempted thesis in the introductory paragraph did not earn the Basic Core point for thesis because it is 
not specific regarding the economic continuities and changes. The statement that “trade-networks  
within Afro-Eurasia remained for a long period of time, as it [sic] underwent several changes, and with 
several continuities that stayed the same from 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E.” was not sufficient to earn the thesis 
point. The essay does address one continuity (the economic importance of slavery, addressed on page 2) and

Question 2 (continued) 

two changes (the rise of Indian Ocean trade and the decline of Silk Roads trade, both addressed on page 1). 
Although the argument for the decline of the Silk Roads in particular is a little overstated, it was deemed 
sufficient. Because it addresses both an economic continuity and an economic change, the essay earned 2 
points for addressing all parts of the question. The essay supports the argument with five relevant pieces of 
evidence, which earned 1 point for evidence support. The credited examples of using evidence were the Silk 
Roads, Indian Ocean trade, the spread of Islam, “better ships (technology),” and the use of slavery. World 
Historical/Global context is used to expand the argument toward the middle of page 1, where the essay 
discusses the impact of the fall of the Roman Empire on encouraging the expansion of Indian Ocean trade. 
Although the explanation is a bit vague, it was sufficient to earn the essay 1 point for using relevant context 
to explain continuity or change. The two instances in which the essay addresses economic change (both on 
page 1) are accompanied by acceptable analysis of the changes. However, since there is no analysis of the 
one continuity that is addressed (on page 2), the essay did not earn the Basic Core point for analysis. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

The essay includes two attempts at a thesis (one in the introductory paragraph and one in the concluding 
paragraph), but neither attempt was deemed sufficient to earn the thesis point. The attempt in the 
introduction addresses two economic changes but does not address a specific continuity, whereas the 
attempt in the conclusion does not address specific continuities and offers a chronologically inaccurate 
statement of continuity: the “dominant European power and trade networks.” The essay did earn 1 point for 
addressing the question because it mentions (toward the middle of page 2) three trade networks that 
remained in operation throughout the period: the trans-Saharan trade networks, the Silk Roads, and the 
Indian Ocean trade networks. The essay did not, however, earn points for addressing economic changes, as 
its attempts to do so (especially the discussion of slavery on pages 1–2) lacked focus and specificity. Slavery 
as an economic institution was too prevalent in the period covered by the question to represent an economic 
change without further qualification specific to a time period and/or geographical region. The essay did not 
earn the Basic Core point for using World Historical/Global context to explain a continuity or a change. 
Several statements that can be read as attempts to bring broader context into the argument are either 
outside the time period of the question (for example, the Opium Wars and the Columbian Exchange), or are 
not used effectively to explain in-period economic continuities or changes (for example, the Church schism 
in Europe or the fall of Rome). Similarly, many of the examples of evidence provided in the essay are either 
not relevant to the question on chronological grounds, or are not linked to aspects or consequences of trade 
networks in any way. Only four examples of relevant, in-period historical evidence are used — the three trade 
networks addressed on page 2 and the mention of slavery on pages 1–2 — not enough to earn the essay any 
points for evidence support. The essay did not earn the Basic Core point for analysis, as there are no 
chronologically accurate attempts at analyzing economic continuities and/or changes.
