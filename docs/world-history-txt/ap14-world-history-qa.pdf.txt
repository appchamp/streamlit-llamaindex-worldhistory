Student Performance Q&A: 

2014 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2014 free-response questions for AP® World History were written by 
the Chief Reader, Dean Ferguson of Texas A & M University-Kingsville and the Question and Exam 
Leaders for each question. They give an overview of each free-response question and of how students 
performed on the question, including typical student errors. General comments regarding the skills 
and content that students frequently have the most problems with are included. Some suggestions 
for improving student performance in these areas are also provided. Teachers are encouraged to 
attend a College Board workshop to learn strategies for improving student performance in specific 
areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

The document-based question (DBQ) directly addressed Curriculum Framework Key Concept 6.2 (Global 
Conflicts and their Consequences) and Curriculum Framework Key Concept 6.3 (New Conceptualizations 
of Global Economy, Society, and Culture).  

Students were asked to analyze the relationship between the Chinese peasants and the Chinese 
Communist Party during the period between 1925 and 1950. The documents lent themselves to an analysis 
that emphasized a deepening relationship over time. Because students were given several documents in 
both the pre-1937 and the post-1949 periods, they were able to see the results of a long process of 
interaction between the peasantry and the Party. 

Most of the document attributions gave students ample opportunity to discuss the point of view of sources 
and identify an additional type of document that was not represented by those included. The detail in the 
documents, as well as their use of evocative language, helped the students to more effectively use the 
documents as evidence and support for analysis.  

Readers responded positively to the scoring guidelines, which asked students to discuss relationships 
between the peasants and the Chinese Communist Party at most score points. Readers believed that this 
rewarded students for effectively answering the question.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

Students performed well on this question by comparison to last year. Students generally understood the 
question and the documents and wrote lengthy essays with some analysis. Readers observed fewer 
nonresponsive or off-topic discussions than in previous years. Moreover, compared to last year the mean 
was noticeably higher. The mean was 2.64 out of a possible 9 points, which demonstrates the quality of the 
question and the students’ ability to respond effectively.

Students who performed well recognized the change in the relationship between the peasants and the 
Chinese Communist Party over time and used the documents to demonstrate this deepening relationship. 
Many students effectively grouped the documents in ways that showed the Communist Party’s 
recognition of the potential power of the peasants and their need for peasant support; the Communist 
Party’s reforms as responses to peasant concerns over land redistribution and inequities; and the 
combined peasant and Communist Party responses to Japanese aggression. It is gratifying to see more 
students attempting to perform all of the tasks demanded by the question (additional document, point of 
view, and grouping), although more work needs to be done to improve analysis and explanation of the 
relationship between the Chinese peasants and the Chinese Communist Party. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Virtually all students attempted the question and wrote longer essays with greater analysis than in the 
past. Errors tended to come from the students’ inability to tie the documents directly to the issue of 
relationships between the peasants and the Chinese Communist Party. A few students were unable to 
effectively respond to the question and analyze the documents because they tried to frame the entire 
discussion as an anti-Communist narrative. 

•  Core point 1 – Although many students were able to identify a relationship between the peasants 
and the Chinese Communist Party, their discussion was often simplistic and lacking in depth. 
Some students attempted to simply characterize the relationship as positive or negative or good or 
bad, which was not acceptable as a thesis without some qualification or explanation. 

•  Core point 2 – Students tended to address all nine documents, although some students omitted a 
single document. Students had the most difficulty with documents 1, 4, and 7, often not clearly 
identifying the relationship or misreading the meanings of the documents. Students still are not 
analyzing the documents’ dates closely or are ignoring dates completely, and thus many missed 
the possibility of developing their analysis around changes over time in the relationship between 
the Chinese peasantry and the Chinese Communist Party. Many clearly did not read the historical 
background, which provided the basic time frame for the question, and as a result failed to apply 
correctly the important skill of chronological reasoning. 

• 

 Core point 3 – Students who understood the documents generally analyzed the documents and 
explained a relationship between the peasants and the Chinese Communist Party. However, some 
students were still using only direct quotes from the documents as sufficient to show evidence and 
therefore lost points. Analysis of the documents must involve student engagement with the 
document. The documents do not speak for themselves.  

•  Core point 4 – Although many students did attempt to discuss point of view of the documents, 

they still did not successfully provide analysis of point of view; a few confused interpretation of the 
document as point of view or made vague statements about bias or reliability based on attribution 
of the document without any form of analysis or explanation. As in previous years, students were 
expected to situate the author or tone of the document. Having done this in some cases, students 
still did not provide an adequate rationale for their claim about perspective. 

•  Core point 5 – Students had to provide an extended discussion of at least two documents that 
identified a relationship between the peasants and the Chinese Communist Party in order to 
constitute a usable group. To earn the core point, students needed to have at least two such 
groups. Students who merely listed documents, but did not have an extended discussion of at least 
two documents, did not receive the point. Some students also grouped the documents around 
characteristics other than the relationship between the peasants and the Party, which also did not 
earn credit. The grouping point was acquired by students who grouped documents by an 
identified relationship between the Communist Party and the peasantry. Other groupings, while 
perhaps accurate, did not reach the standard for this core point.

•  Core point 6 – Students often asked for another point of view or document that was potentially 

relevant but did not explain how it would enhance understanding of the relationship between the 
peasants and the Chinese Communist Party. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Teachers should be commended for having their students address all of the requirements of the DBQ. 
However, teachers need to continue to model and allocate time to practice parsing the question and 
addressing all of the requirements within the context of the tasks posed by the question. Some students 
are still attempting to group the documents and the essay in terms of “social-political-economic,” without 
considering the requirements of the question or their interpretations of the documents; this is often 
ineffective. Teachers need to encourage students to group the documents in direct relation to the task of 
the question, instead of using grouping formulas. Teachers should continue to encourage students to use 
all of the documents in the set and to omit none. While this particular question only required two 
groupings, teachers should continue to require students to develop at least three or more groups. As has 
been stated in the past, more needs to be done to enforce the point of view and additional document 
requirements as analytical tools throughout the course, and not just a requirement for this exam. These 
elements are most effective when integrated within the essay as a standard part of analytic writing. 

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

The question addressed directly each of the four subpoints in the Curriculum Framework Key Concept 
4.1(Globalizing Networks of Communication and Exchange) IV. The question is also tied to Curriculum 
Framework Key Concept 4.2 (New Forms of Social Organization and Modes of Production) I B. 

The intent of this question was for students to select one of the regions provided (Latin America, including 
the Caribbean; sub-Saharan Africa; or Southeast Asia) and then identify and explain changes and 
continuities in the selected region’s participation in interregional trade between circa 1500 and 1750. In 
particular, the question measured the historical thinking skill of chronological reasoning (Skill 2), especially 
the subskill of working with patterns of change and continuity over time. The question directly addresses 
the fourth theme of the course (Creation, Expansion, and Interaction of Economic Systems) within a period 
(1500–1750) when that theme is substantially related to many other historical developments.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score on this question was 1.88 out of a possible 9 points. 

Most students chose to write on Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority of those selecting 
Latin America. Students writing on these geographic regions frequently demonstrated basic 
understanding of the political circumstances during this period, namely, political control of Latin America 
by European powers and strong European influences in Africa. Students were often able to demonstrate 
considerable knowledge of important background information for answering the question, for example, the 
Columbian Exchange, plantation production systems in Latin America, processes of acquiring slaves in 
Africa, and the horrible treatment and conditions African slaves endured. As a result, students had an 
abundance of relevant content to write about. Stronger essays described the processes and linked them to 
trade, while the most sophisticated essays not only tied the processes directly to interregional trade, but 
also used them to provide substantive analysis. Because much of this background information is germane 
to a discussion of trade during the period, most students were able to provide evidence in the essay that 
could be scored as on point, especially when they identified the products of each region. In general, 
students were able to provide explanation within the essays, though explanations were not always clearly 
linked to a change or continuity in interregional trade. Many students were also able to address the world

historical context, either by providing a third region or identifying a global pattern of trade; for example, 
the movement of Latin American silver to China.  

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Despite the fact that many students had considerable content to write about, many essays focused on 
changes or continuities or both in production of goods or commodities rather than articulating the changes 
and continuities in the interregional trade of those commodities. Students who concentrated on changes 
or continuities in the production processes of particular commodities could earn points for evidence, but 
little else. Similarly, students with considerable historical background wrote substantially about cultural 
diffusion, a byproduct of interregional trade, without directly addressing the changes or continuities in the 
trade of material goods that facilitated that diffusion. Also, many students’ responses were so generic in 
their discussion of trade that the essays did not articulate an understanding of interregional trade. 
Responses that demonstrated a deliberate attempt to discuss intraregional trade as a result of a misread of 
the prompt, however, were not numerous. Some errors were far more common. For example, many 
students who chose to write about Southeast Asia actually wrote essays about China or Japan that, as a 
result, could earn very few points. Similarly, many essays focused on political or social changes and 
continuities in the regions and articulated very little about interregional trade that could be scored. Finally, 
the most common error by far was the inability of students to craft a thesis statement. Attempts at thesis 
statements were typically far too generic or only addressed a change or a continuity without incorporating 
an assessment of both.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

The foremost recommendation is that teachers should coach students to plan more in order to write more 
organized and focused essays. Teachers should coach students to take the first few minutes of the time 
devoted to the essay to parse the prompt carefully, identifying key task words and content areas so that 
they know precisely what the prompt asks them to do. Students should practice creating a plan for the 
essay — a grid, a flowchart, or a skeletal outline — that includes specific, on-point evidence. Using this 
process, students can then generate a specific and focused thesis. 

As noted, teachers need to spend considerable time developing the habit of parsing the prompt with their 
students. This is the first, most important, step in writing an essay that is responsive to the prompt; it 
really is the heart of the analytic skills being measured in the essay. To that end, teachers need to spend 
time developing in students adequate understanding of the vocabulary of essay prompts as well as the 
vocabulary of the Curriculum Framework (i.e., interregional rather than intraregional). Teachers should also 
have students practice parsing the prompt and crafting a thesis as a joint process. Teachers should tailor 
this process appropriately to the level of their students, remembering that coaching a two-sentence thesis 
where one sentence identifies a change concretely and the second identifies a concrete continuity may 
lead to more student success than trying to force the students into something overly complicated. 
Teachers should also move away from training students to produce a generic thesis that only labels 
changes or continuities (perhaps based on PERSIA or APPARTS) to one that is more focused on addressing 
the change and continuity in the content area of the specific tasks set by the prompt.  

Teachers should model global-local analysis in their classrooms, consistently linking global movements to 
local and regional circumstances and the reverse, explicitly identifying those links to their students, and 
repeatedly requiring students to practice making those links themselves.  

Teachers need to ensure that their students have a solid grasp of the regions of the world and which 
polities or peoples comprise those regions.

Question 3 

What was the intent of this question? 

The intent of the question was for students to identify and explain similarities and differences in the ways 
two of the three empires listed (Mauryan/Gupta, Islamic Caliphates, Byzantine) used religion to rule until 
1450.  

The question measured the historical thinking skill of comparison and contextualization (Skill 3) and 
student understanding of Key Concept 2.1 (The Development and Codification of Religious and Cultural 
Traditions) and Key Concept 3.2 (Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and Their Interactions). The 
question assessed students’ content and thematic knowledge of periods 2 and 3, especially their thematic 
understanding of the use of religion to rule.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score for this question was 1.73 out of 9 points. 

Many students seemed to know a fair amount about the empires in question during this period, as well as 
the period before and afterward. There were noticeably fewer unresponsive essays, where students failed 
to answer the question, compared to last year, and students wrote more than often is the case for the final 
essay question of the exam. That said, much of the information students presented was not tied directly to 
the empires’ use of religion to govern, which lowered scores on several rubric points. Students often wrote 
about the religious, cultural, political, and military histories of the regions, many times without connecting 
the use of religion to the purposes and strategies of governance. On the other hand, some of the stronger 
responses managed to apply the use of religion to multiple facets of governance, such as unification of 
diverse peoples through religious customs and incorporation of religious texts into law. 

Though the mean score was low, numerous students did author excellent essays that related directly to 
state use of religion to rule in the empires selected. Students routinely earned the point for addressing 
similarity or difference along with the direct comparison, as most were able to write using clear and direct 
comparative language. Often, students adequately addressed a similarity but then were unable to 
complete the comparison by exploring a difference in the way the two chosen empires employed religion 
to rule. Students frequently failed to offer historically supported analysis or explanation of a reason, or 
reasons, for a similarity or difference in the ways the chosen empires used religion to govern. The small 
percentage of students who met the core requirements of the rubric and who wrote multiple, nuanced 
comparisons accompanied by analysis earned 2 expanded-core points on the 9-point scale. Though most 
essays were able to provide evidence connected to the topic, evidence points were at times all they 
earned. When students did respond to the dual components of the topic, the essays were often in the mid-
high range or better. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

The most frequent error was misreading or inverting the prompt, which in turn affected students’ abilities 
to gain credit for their thesis, for addressing the question, and for employing valid evidence. Successful 
theses needed to address valid differences and similarities in how both empires used religion to govern. 
For example, to say that both empires practiced religion or were influenced by religion would not be 
acceptable for a complete answer to the prompt. Incomplete comparisons or inverted comparisons were 
problematic, as many students wrote on how religion influenced government. The prompt directed 
students to examine the use of religion by the state, rather than discussing how religion influenced state 
actors. Failed theses that were accurate as either a similarity or difference could earn 1 point for 
addressing these aspects.

Most students did offer examples of similarity or difference in their essays, though many of these were not 
credited due to the fact that they did not address comparisons between the empires’ use of religion to 
govern. To say that both empires “were tolerant of religious minorities,” for example, does not explain how 
that tolerance contributed to governing.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP® Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Most importantly, students should learn to assess and answer the prompt. Far more mistakes were made 
due to misunderstanding of the question than any other single reason. It is likely that a more thorough 
reading of the prompt would allow students to write more effectively about what they know about the 
subject.  

Second, teachers would be well advised to continue to work on thesis writing with students. This is, of 
course, an acquired skill, one that when learned often leads to stronger essays. Students should address 
the major parts of the prompt, qualifying their claim in a way that moves beyond the prompt itself. For 
example, “While both the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Caliphates used their respective religions to 
unify their peoples, the Byzantine Empire relied on a secular law code with less influence from religious 
texts than the caliphates, which incorporated the Quran into their legal code, sharia.” 

Students can learn to make their comparisons more complex and always include an explanation for their 
claims in order to receive credit for direct comparison and analysis. For example, “Though the Islamic 
Caliphates incorporated the Quran into their legal code to form sharia, the Byzantines relied on a secular 
code with minor influences from religious texts. The difference is due to the fact that the Islamic 
Caliphates were heavily influenced by the ruling example of Muhammad, while the Byzantines inherited 
their legal traditions from the Roman Empire and its legal code.”
