2014 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 3 

Overview 

The intent of this question was for students to identify and explain similarities and differences in the way 
two empires (Maurya/Gupta, Islamic Caliphates, Byzantine) used religion to rule until 1450. In particular, 
the question measured the historical thinking skill of comparison and contextualization (Skill 3) and Key 
Concept 2.1 (The Development and Codification of Religious and Cultural Traditions) and Key Concept 3.2 
(Continuity and Innovation of State Forms and Their Interactions). The question assessed content and 
thematic knowledge of Periods 2 and 3, especially students’ thematic understanding of the use of religion 
to rule. 

Sample: 3A  
Score: 8 

The first paragraph combines several sentences to address a similarity in the way the Byzantine Empire and 
the Islamic Caliphates used religion to establish rulers and regimes and a difference in the use of religion to 
establish laws (1 point). Similarity of rulers as religious figures is addressed in the second paragraph, and a 
similar use of religion to support conquest appears in the third paragraph, while a difference in the use of 
religion to create law is addressed in the fourth paragraph (2 points). Other similarities are found in the 
second paragraph, regarding the establishment of rulers as head religious figures, and in the third paragraph 
comparing the use of religion to justify expansion; the fourth paragraph explains a difference between the 
Byzantine secular laws only mildly influenced by Christianity as opposed to Islamic sharia law based directly 
on the Quran (1 point). Causes for similarities and differences include attempts to deter unrest and increase 
control over subjects, the use of religion to inspire military action to gain new land or reclaim lost land, and 
the secular nature of the Roman legal code compared to sharia law (1 point). There are nine pieces of valid 
evidence, five relating to the Islamic Caliphates and four relating to the Byzantine Empire (2 points). The 
essay earned all the core points, and it provided strong analysis to earn an expanded core point (1 point). 

Sample: 3B  
Score: 4 

The attempted thesis does not adequately qualify similarities or differences in how empires used religion to 
rule. In the second paragraph, the student successfully addresses a similarity in the Islamic Caliphates’ use of 
the Quran in law and the Byzantine use of religion to shape political views, but the attempt at addressing a 
difference fails to connect the use of religion to rule (1 point). The treatment of similarity in the second 
paragraph is also a direct comparison (1 point). The essay contains five pieces of valid evidence, three 
relating to Islam and two relating to Christianity (2 points). 

Sample: 3C 
Score: 1 

This essay includes an attempt at a thesis in the first paragraph but inadequately ties differences in 
religion to how those religions were used to govern. Much of the paragraph is a restatement of the prompt. 
Attempts at similarity and difference are incorrect, even though the structure of comparison and contrast 
is in place. The essay contains three pieces of valid evidence (1 point).
