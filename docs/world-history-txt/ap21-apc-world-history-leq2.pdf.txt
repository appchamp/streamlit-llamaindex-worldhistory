Question 2: Long Essay Question, Economic and Commercial Practices in Afro-Eurasia 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

In the period circa 1200–1450, commerce along exchange networks such as the Silk Roads, the Indian Ocean, and the trans-Saharan networks involved 
a number of new economic and commercial practices. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which developments in economic and/or commercial practices in Afro-Eurasia affected trade in this 
period.

Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of 
reasoning. 

Scoring Criteria 

Responses that do not earn this point: 
•  Are not historically defensible. 
•  Only restate or rephrase the prompt. 
•  Do not respond to the prompt. 
•  Do not establish a line of reasoning. 
•  Are overgeneralized. 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn this point: 
•  Provide a historically defensible thesis or claim about the extent to which economic or 
commercial practices in Afro-Eurasia affected trade in the period circa 1200–1450, with 
some indication of the reasoning for making that claim.

• 

“The expansion of empires increased trade in Afro-Eurasia.” 

Provide a historically defensible claim, but do not establish a line 
of reasoning  
• 

“New commercial practices affected trade in Afro-Eurasia in the 
period 1200–1450.” 

Establish a line of reasoning, but do not provide a historically 
defensible claim  
• 

“The establishment of joint-stock companies in Afro-Eurasia in 
the period 1200–1450 greatly increased trade because they 
allowed investors to pool large amounts of capital.” 

Examples that earn this point: 

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt 
• 

“New commercial practices such as letters of credit greatly increased trade in Afro-
Eurasia because they made it easier for merchants to purchase goods.” 

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic 
categories 
•

• 

“Trade increased because of the spread of new commercial infrastructure.”  (Minimally 
acceptable thesis/claim) 

Additional Notes: 
•  The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the 

first or last paragraphs). 

•  The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
• 

Identify at least two specific historical examples relevant 
to developments in economic or commercial practices in 
Afro-Eurasia in the period circa 1200–1450. 

Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include 
the following (two examples required): 
•  Specific technologies that facilitated increased trade such 

as the camel saddle and the dhow 

•  Economic practices such as the use of camel caravans to 

Examples that do not earn points:

Provide evidence that is not relevant 
to the topic of the prompt. 
“The trans-Saharan trade routes were 
vital for the growth of the Mali Empire.” 

•  The development of commercial partnerships in the 

Mediterranean region and the Indian Ocean 

•  The development of the ortaq system under the Mongols 

to facilitate commerce across Eurasia 

Example of a statement that earns one point for evidence: 
• 

“The development of specific commercial practices such as 
banking or issuing bills of exchange, letters of credit, or 
paper money occurred in this period.” 

• 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
•  Use at least two specific historical examples to 

support an argument regarding how economic or 
commercial practices in Afro-Eurasia affected trade 
in the period circa 1200–1450. 

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence:  
• 

“The establishment of specific commercial 
infrastructure such as caravanserai, ports, and 
postal relay stations greatly facilitated trade along 
major trade routes during this period, by providing 
safe resting stations for merchants or speeding up 
written communications between traders living in 
different cities.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence to support the argument that new 
economic and commercial practices affected trade 
in Afro-Eurasia during the period circa 1200–1450) 
“New commercial practices emerged during this 
period as merchants tried to manage the risks of 
long-distance trade. For example, the Mongol ortaq 
system involved merchants forming partnerships 
that involved cooperation both in the actual trade 
of goods and in the financing of trading voyages. 
Likewise, in the Italian city-states, new financial 
practices gave rise to commercial banking and 
letters of credit.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of 
evidence to support the argument that new 
economic and commercial practices affected trade 
in Afro-Eurasia during the period circa 1200–1450) 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization. 
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two. 
(For example, changes in commercial practices affected trade more significantly in some regions than others; changes in commercial practices significantly 
affected trade across all of Afro-Eurasia.)

Analysis and 
Reasoning 

(0–2 points) 

Scoring Criteria 

0 points 
Does not meet the criteria 
for one point. 

1 point 
Uses historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, 
continuity and change) to frame or structure an 
argument that addresses the prompt. 

2 points 
Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development 
that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or 
modify an argument that addresses the question. 

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that do not 
earn points: 
•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning 
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument. 

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
do not use it to frame 
or structure an 
argument. 

Examples that do not earn 
points: 

Provide evidence but offer 
no reasoning to connect 
the evidence to an 
argument 
•

“China during the 
Song, Yuan, and Ming 
periods was renowned 
for producing fine 
porcelain, which was 
in high demand as a 
trade item.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 

explain how developments in economic or 
commercial practices affected trade in Afro-Eurasia 
in the period 1200–1450. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining the ways in which the construction of 
commercial infrastructure increased regional and 
transregional trade. 

•  Explaining how changes in trading patterns or 

volumes were influenced by the introduction of 
new economic practices. 

•  Explaining how new commercial practices affected 

regional trade in similar or different ways. 

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 
“The Mongols’ development of commercial 
infrastructure, as well as their financial innovations, 
led to a tremendous expansion of Silk Roads trade.” 
(Establishes two types of developments that 
changed trade in the relevant period. This 
statement would need to be followed up with at 
least minimal discussion of the two categories 
introduced.) 

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 

periods. 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple 

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence. 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining how new commercial practices were very important in 

leading to an increase in trade in some regions while new commercial 
practices only had a marginal effect on trade in other regions of Afro-
Eurasia. For instance, a response could highlight the changes that 
occurred in the Silk Roads trade as a result of the Mongol conquests 
and their economic policies, while also noting that areas not 
connected directly to the Silk Roads saw limited effects from these 
changes. (Explains nuance, considers both causes and effects, and 
qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 
such as explaining how the introduction of new commercial practices 
in later periods also led to an increase in trade. For instance, a 
response could discuss how the commercial practices of the Song and 
Yuan dynasties led Europeans to seek routes to Asia for access to 
trade goods, which led to the development of transoceanic trade after 
1450. (Explains relevant and insightful connections)

• 

Illustrating that the introduction of new economic practices did not 
always significantly impact trade in some regions because the positive 
economic effects of the introduction of new practices were 
sometimes negated by political events such as war. For instance, a 
response could highlight the rise in prosperity that occurred in the 
Mongol Empire, while qualifying the argument by noting the 
destructiveness of the Mongol conquests—the sack of Baghdad for 
instance—and how this destruction harmed economies and trade in 
the short term. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Demonstrating how the introduction of the same new economic 

practice in different regions led to increased trade in both regions. For 
instance, a response could discuss how the development of letters of 
credit in Europe and China led to economic growth in Song China and 
during the Italian Renaissance. (Corroborates an argument, considers 
both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•

This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 2 — Long Essay Question  

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to this question were expected to demonstrate students’ ability to analyze the role that economic 
and/or commercial practices played in affecting trade between 1200 and 1450 C.E. It prompted students to 
address topics included in 2.1: The Silk Roads, Topic 2.3; Exchange in the Indian Ocean, Topic 2.4; Trans-
Saharan Trade Routes; and/or 2.7, Comparison of Economic Exchange in the AP World History Curriculum 
and Framework. The question was open geographically to allow responses about multiple regions and a time 
period that guided students to the topics listed above, but also open to student responses that demonstrated 
familiarity with developments in European trade toward the end of the period.  

The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of economic 
and commercial practices on trade, and the students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, 
describe a historical context, use at least two specific examples of evidence, use the evidence to support an 
argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame an argument, and demonstrate a 
complex understanding of the historical development. Students could use any historical thinking skill to 
demonstrate this understanding, and we saw successful responses that compared the developments of 
different trade routes, discussed effects of specific developments on individual trade routes, or evaluated the 
extent of the changes and impact on trade routes over time.

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point at the end of the first paragraph, by arguing that “new technology, and new 
systems of trade” affected trade in Afro-Eurasia to a “massive” extent.  

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point in the first paragraph for outlining the background of long-distance trade in 
Afro-Eurasia, mentioning trade between the “Abbasid Caliphate and Song China” as well as between these 
“large states” and Indian states and Ghana. The statement also mentions the “diffusion of ideas and 
technology” as an effect of the trade in this period. 

C. Evidence (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point by identifying specific new technologies such as the astrolabe, magnetic 
compass, new sailing techniques, Chinese junks, Indian Ocean dhows, and caravanserais. There is additional 
evidence throughout the response.  

The response earned the second evidence point by using the evidence it identifies in support of an argument 
about how new sea-based technologies caused a boom in trade. For example, the response explains, “Once 
monsoon winds in the Indian Ocean were charted, trade flourished because of merchants’ ability to surely go 
back and forth between East Africa and India via the Indian Ocean.” There are several additional arguments

supported by evidence (for example, an argument that the Trans-Saharan trade grew because of the building of 
caravanserais). 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned the point for historical reasoning by using numerous arguments demonstrating how new 
commercial and economic developments led to historical change. 

The response earned the point for demonstrating complex understanding through a nuanced discussion of 
multiple technologies and their impact on various world regions. The response also makes several insightful 
connections across historical contexts—for example, the response explains how periods of increased political 
support for trade such as the Pax Mongolica and the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate helped trade flourish. In 
the last paragraph the response shows how increases in trade contributed to the decline of feudalism in Europe 
and led to the age of European exploration, ultimately allowing Europeans to become directly involved in the 
Indian Ocean trade network.

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point in the last two sentences, by stating, “From a standardized currency to lateen 
sails, trade between merchants has been made much easier and far more reliable across seas. Without new 
technologies … traveling through the seas would be close to impossible.” This statement addresses a 
commercial/economic practice and an effect on trade. There is another attempt at thesis in the first sentence: 
“Many commercial and economic practices have been adopted to make trade safer, more efficient, and much 
more profitable. Inventions and ideas have been adopted to optimize the process of trade,” but it is not as well 
developed. 

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point. There is not a clear attempt to explain historical context.  

C. Evidence (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point by identifying relevant evidence such as lateen sails, stern rudders, and 
compasses. There is also additional evidence (for example, a reference to standardized currency) later in the 
response.  

The response earned the second evidence point by using the evidence provided in support of an argument that 
“navigational technologies helped make sea-based trade routes … much safer and efficient.” There is also a 
secondary argument that new commercial and economic practices also made long distance trade “much more 
profitable,” but it is not well supported. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 1 
The response earned the point for historical reasoning by explaining changes that had an effect on trade due to 
new commercial practices, including navigational technologies. This is demonstrated in several places,

including the third paragraph, where the response argues that “[b]y combining these three technologies, 
merchants were able navigate sea-based trade routes with ease, speed, and safety. This increased the desire 
for overseas trade which in return increased the amount of resources being imported and exported.” 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating  complex understanding. There is no complex or 
nuanced analysis of the evidence or insightful connections to other periods or historical contexts.

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point for the second sentence in the first paragraph: “For example developments in 
new or better transportation methods allowed better ways for merchants to travel and for better and more 
exports and imports from places.” This constitutes a minimally acceptable thesis because it references both 
commercial practices (“better transportation methods”) and its impact on trade (increased imports and 
exports). There is another thesis attempt in the last sentence, but it would not have earned the point because it 
addresses practices but not an effect on trade. 

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point. The attempt in the first sentence is a restatement of information found in 
the prompt. 

C. Evidence (0−3 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for using evidence. The only attempt is the last sentence, which makes a 
vague reference to developments in manufacturing, labor, and technology advancements but does not include 
specific examples. 

The response did not earn the point for supporting an argument with evidence. There is an attempt to 
formulate an argument in this sentence: “Making trade routes easier and just overall trade easier,” but no 
specific evidence is used, and the argument is not fully developed. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for using historical reasoning. The only attempt to address an effect on 
trade is within the thesis. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating complex understanding as it does not offer a complex 
understanding.
