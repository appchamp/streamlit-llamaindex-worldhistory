“Describe and explain a significant continuity and a significant change in labor migration in the period 
1450–1750 C.E.” (Historical thinking skill: Continuity and Change) 

Please note: 

•  Each point of the rubric is earned independently, e.g., a student could earn the point for synthesis 

without earning the point for thesis. 

•  Unique evidence from the student response is required to earn each point, e.g., evidence in the 

student response that qualifies for either of the targeted skill points could not be used to earn the 
point for thesis. 

Scoring Criteria  
Thesis: Presents a thesis that 
makes a historically defensible 
claim and responds to all parts of 
the question. The thesis must 
consist of one or more sentences 
located in one place, either in the 
introduction or the conclusion.   
(1 point) 

Argument Development — 
Describes: Describes a historical 
continuity AND a change.  
(1 point) 

Notes 
•  Must address at least one continuity and at least 
one change in labor migrations and have some 
explanatory element for each. 

•  Does NOT have to mention specific migrations. 
•  Sample: A continuity during this period in labor 
migration was the forced movement of artisans, 
manual laborers, and prisoners by states to build 
empires, while a major change was the 
development of North American colonies where 
free, forced, and indentured migrant laborers were 
used to build new economies. 

•  Must describe/identify at least one relevant example 
of continuity and one example of change in labor 
migration in the period 1450–1750 C.E.

argument by explaining the 
connection between the 
argument and either a 
development in a  

•  different historical 

period 

•  geographical area  
•  a course theme and/or 
approach that is not the 
focus of the essay or  
•  a different discipline. 

(1 point) 

• 

• 
• 

• 

(Period) may offer a relevant connection between 
the in-period continuity and/or change in labor 
migration and developments in other periods, e.g. 
during 1750−1900 C.E. or 1945−2000. 
(Geography) not allowable because prompt is global. 
(Theme) may connect the continuity and/or change 
in labor migration in this period to a course theme 
or approach that is NOT economic history. 
Examples might include migrations driven by 
religious or environmental factors. 
(Discipline) may connect the argument to a different 
discipline, such as political science, sociology, or 
demography, to extend a discussion of the 
continuity and/or change in labor migration.

2017 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Long Essay Question 2 

Overview 

The intent of this question was to assess students’ knowledge of continuties and changes in patterns of 
labor migration in the period between 1450 and 1750 C.E. This content is part of Key Concepts 4.1, 4.2, and 
4.3 of the AP World History Curriculum Framework (Globalizing Networks of Communication and 
Exchange; New Forms of Social Organization and Modes of Production; and State Consolidation and 
Imperial Expansion). The question’s geographic scope was global, and its choronological scope 
encompassed the period of new large-scale mass migrations from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas that 
followed the Age of Exploration, as well as the continuation of previous patterns of labor migrations, such 
as intra-Africa slavery, slave trade networks in the Muslim World, and global rural-to-urban migration 
movements. The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their knowledge of multiple 
types of labor migrations, including involuntary migration (slavery, indentured servitude) and voluntary 
migration (for economic, religious, or political reasons). Students were expected to present a historically 
defensible thesis, describe both a historical continuity and a historical change in labor migrations during 
this period, explain the reasons for the historical continuity and the reasons for the historical change, 
address the topic with specific examples of relevant evidence, deploy the evidence to fully and effectively 
substantiate the thesis or a relevant argument, and extend the argument by either connecting it to a 
different course theme or another discipline or by comparing it to developments in other time periods. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 6 

The thesis presented in the first paragraph is sufficient to have earned the thesis point. The change is 
identified in the first sentence, where the response identifies that “European hegemony” evolves as a result 
of labor migrations following the discovery of the New World in 1492. The continuity of African slave trade is 
correctly identified as having continued since the ancient period. 

The essay earned the first argument development point for describing a continuity and a change. The 
continuity of slave trade is identified in the beginning of the second paragraph. The first sentence of this 
paragraph identifies the continuation of the slave trade and not simply the labor system of slavery. The essay 
identifies earlier examples of this slave trade, and then connects them to the forced labor migration of African 
slaves in this time period. A change is described in the fourth paragraph, by identifying the evolving 
European hegemony due to the African slave trade previously introduced. 

The essay earned the second argument development point for explaining a historical continuity and a 
change. The assertion of change is discussed quite thoroughly in the third paragraph, where the developing 
Atlantic slave trade is explained through the implementation of mercantilism and the need for cheap labor 
sources. The continuity of the brutality of slave trade is discussed in the second body paragraph, where the 
continued selling of enemies into slavery is explained as a result of needed goods. The continued need for 
these goods and weapons leads to the practice continuing throughout the time period. 

The essay provides several examples that earned the first using evidence point, including naming of specific 
tribes (Ashanti), the goods traded for (guns), and evolving ethnic divides (Creole, peninsulares, etc.).

Long Essay Question 2 (continued) 

The essay earned the second using evidence point for effective substantiation by using evidence in several 
instances to substantiate the argument being made. In the second body paragraph, for example, the 
evidence of earlier time period slave trade complements the evidence provided of slave trade within this 
period (Ashanti, guns, etc.) to substantiate a solid argument about the continuity of slave trade as a forced 
migration. 

The essay provides an especially high-level synthesis response, which earned the synthesis point. The essay 
does an exceptional job of connecting developments in art history with the forced slave migrations. While the 
essay develops an argument about continued poor treatment on the slave trade routes, the final paragraph 
connects this clearly to the Impressionist movement and a specific image by Joseph Turner. The essay also 
explains the cause of the connection, which lies in the inhumanity of the social hierarchy that developed 
around the justification of slavery.  

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The essay attempts a thesis but failed to earn the point for several reasons. Most significantly the argument 
being presented, “laborers working under harsh conditions,” is an argument about labor, but not migration. 
In addition, the identification of change and continuity lack the necessary explanatory element necessary. 

The essay earned the first argument development point. The essay identifies a change in labor migration in 
the first sentence of the second paragraph. This identification includes the phrase “continued to migrate” 
and the clarification “under very harsh conditions” so that it meets expectations for describing a change in 
the migration itself. The paragraph goes on to describe the specific “horrible conditions” of the Middle 
Passage. The description of change in the first five lines of the third paragraph identifies the use of slave 
trade to the Americas as a change in the time period through reference to the increase in the “frequency” 
and referencing “more” slaves being taken to plantations in the New World.  

The essay did not earn the second argument development point. Though a continuity in labor migration 
“under very harsh conditions” is identified, the essay fails to explain why this practice continued. Similarly 
the change identified (increased slavery to the New World) is never explained. 

The essay earned the first using evidence point by providing multiple examples with connections to labor 
migrations, including identification of “African slaves,” “plantations” as the end point of the harsh treatment 
of slave migration, and specific details of the harsh treatment (disease, overcrowding, etc.). 

The essay earned the second using evidence point by using evidence to substantiate the continued harsh 
treatment seen in slave migrations in the first body paragraph. The details of the harsh treatment reinforce 
the argument that this treatment was a continuous element of the forced migration of slaves. 

The essay earned the synthesis point in the third paragraph by exploring the development of new social 
classes influenced by the continued importation (forced migration) of slaves. The essay develops this 
assertion with a detailed explanation of the demographic changes in plantation society.

Long Essay Question 2 (continued) 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

The essay did not earn the thesis point. While the attempt at identifying a continuity argument in the first 
paragraph (“use of slaves and agriculture”) opens the door to an acceptable continuity, it does not connect 
the “use” of slaves to their forced migration. Similarly, the attempted change focuses on trade routes and 
methods of travel, rather than identifying an element of labor migration that changed. 

The essay did not earn the first argument development point. The attempt to develop a slavery argument 
never advances beyond connecting the use of slavery to the migration of slaves. The same holds true of the 
agricultural element, which is a labor argument but not tied to migration. The essay does identify the use of 
ships to transport African slaves, but this is not a historically accurate change (as ships had been used for 
transport for years.) 

The essay did not earn the second argument development point. No acceptable arguments are introduced 
and so explanation is not possible. 

The essay fulfills the minimum expectation of two evidence points, so it earned the first using evidence 
point. It identifies slaves dying of disease from their transport and then identifies the “Middle Passage.” 

The essay did not earn the second using evidence point because minimal evidence is presented, and it is not 
effectively used to substantiate an argument about labor migration. 

The last paragraph could be interpreted as a failed attempt at synthesis. It demonstrates no connection to an 
argument or clear feature of labor migration, and so it did not earn the synthesis point.
