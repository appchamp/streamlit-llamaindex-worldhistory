Document 1  

Source: Justo Sierra, male Mexican minister of public education, letter to the editors of La Mujer 
Mexicana (The Mexican Woman), Mexico, 1904.  

The educated woman will be truly dedicated to the home; she will be a companion and collaborator of 
man in the formation of the family. That is what we want. I do not want to see you pursue your 
feminism to the extreme of wishing to convert yourselves into men; that is not what we desire; for 
then all of life‚Äôs enchantment would be lost. No; let men fight over political questions, let them form 
laws; you ought to fight the good fight, that of feeling, and form souls, which is better than forming 
laws.

Document 2  

Source: Hermila Galindo, Mexican feminist and political speaker, supporter of  Mexican 
revolutionaries, speech at the Second Feminist Congress of Yucatan, Mexico, 1916. 

A woman needs suffrage and asks for it from a moral standpoint, because of what she can do with  
the vote.  She needs it so that she can combat alcoholism, prostitution, juvenile delinquency, 
pornography, and everything that works against child morality.  She needs it so that she can guard 
her own health as well as that of the public, to work for better worker housing, better schools, better 
markets, etc.

Document 4  

Source: Ricardo Dolz, Cuban senator, speech to the Cuban Senate on a bill to give married women 
economic rights, Havana, Cuba, 1917.. 

Women should have their rights because the movement is recognized worldwide, it is just and 
moderate, and the women are not asking to dominate men. Resisting the woman‚Äôs movement will 
encourage women activists to become socialists and fulfill everyone‚Äôs greatest fear. 

Document 5
 

Source: Mar√≠a Luisa Mar√≠n, anarchist and union organizer, speech in support of jailed communist 
politician Her√≥n Proal in the rent-strike movement in Veracruz, Mexico, December 1924. 

We will do what we can so that our children will not denounce us as traitors and cowards. We will 
prove that with Proal or without him, the Veracruz renters will defend their rights.  In view of the 
danger that now threatens us, we issue an urgent call to the people.  Don‚Äôt wait for the powerful to 
help you. They will never appreciate the dignity and value of our solidarity which some day will 
triumph.  The supreme hour of the people has arrived.  People of Veracruz, wake up and join the 
struggle. 

Document 6
 

Source: Colonel Crescencio Trevi√±o Adame, veteran of the Mexican Revolution, private letter to 
Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas, 1938. 

Undoubtedly, granting Mexican women powers to govern would be a disaster because woman can be 
more criminal than man. Woman is in this world for the man‚Äôs home, not for politics or to mix with 
the affairs of men. This thing that they are talking about, this women‚Äôs vote, would be madness.

The Sandinista Popular Revolution will abolish the discrimination that women have suffered with 
respect to men: it will establish economic, political, and cultural equality between women and men.  
It will elevate the political, cultural, and vocational level of women via their participation in the 
revolutionary process.

Document 9  

Source: Orbelina Soza Meirena, female community activist, interview with Latin American historian 
Barbara Seitz on women‚Äôs roles in the Nicaraguan revolution in 1989, published in 1994.  

When the Sandinista Front began, women also within the lines fought in the role of men; that is when 
the women realized that we can work the same as a man, that we can develop equally as a man. The 
women were heroines. They showed us, they really gave us the idea that the woman in the world, in 
life, in work, can be equal to a man. 

Document 10
  

Source: Chilean woman speaking at the First National Meeting of the Female Temporary Agricultural 
Workers, Santiago, Chile, June 1993.   

‚ÄúCompa√±eras [Sisters],  it is all fine to talk about solidarity with men, but how many of you have 
husbands who wash dishes or take care of children?  How many of you have husbands who let you go 
to meetings or like the fact that you work?  And‚ÄîI know none of us wants to talk about this‚Äîbut 
how many of you have husbands who are abusive, who beat you for whatever whim?‚Äù
