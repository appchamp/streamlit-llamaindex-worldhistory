Short Answer Question 1 

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 

“The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the 
elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more 
constrained the power of governments, the more power is diffused, checked, and balanced, the less it will 
aggress on others and commit mass violence. At the extremes of power, totalitarian governments slaughter 
their people by the tens of millions. In contrast, many democracies can barely bring themselves to execute even 
serial murderers.” 

Rudolph Rummel, United States political scientist, 
Death by Government, 1994 

a) Identify ONE historical example of mass violence that was committed by a totalitarian state in the twentieth 

century that would support Rummel’s argument in the passage. 

b) Explain ONE historical example of a democratic state committing mass violence that would challenge 

Rummel’s argument regarding democracies and mass violence. 

c) Explain ONE development in the late twentieth century that likely shaped Rummel’s view of the relationship 

between democracy and mass violence.

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  The Nazi Holocaust is an example of mass violence committed by a totalitarian state. 
•  The genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge is an example of mass violence committed by a 

totalitarian state. 

•  The liquidation of the Ukrainian kulaks under Stalin is an example of mass violence committed by a 

totalitarian state. 

•  The “Great Terror” committed by the Soviet Union under Stalin in the late 1930s is an example of mass 

violence by a totalitarian state that would support the argument in the passage. 

•  The Chinese communist government under Mao Zedong used mass violence to force people to accept 

communist policies during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

• 

In the nineteenth century European states such as Britain and France violated their democratic 
principles by using mass violence to crush African resistance to European rule. 

•  British soldiers and settlers committed mass violence against indigenous populations in Australia, 

thereby showing that democracies do commit mass violence. 

•  The firebombing of Dresden during World War II challenges the author’s argument that democracies 
will not commit acts of mass violence because the Dresden bombing was a deliberate use of terror 
designed to break the will of the German population.  

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Rummel’s view was likely shaped by the end of the Cold War when the United States and its 

democratic allies had emerged victorious over totalitarian regimes such as the communist Soviet 
Union. 

•  The argument in the passage was likely shaped by the development of a liberal international order 
after the Second World War, which included the development of institutions such as the United 
Nations that advocated for peace and international cooperation. 

•  Ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Serbian forces in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s would likely have 

shaped Rummel’s arguments about the relationship between democracies and mass violence because 
Serbia was an authoritarian state under Slobodan Milosevic. 

•  Rummel’s assertion that democratic states will not engage in mass violence was likely shaped by 

conservative thinkers who argued after the end of the Cold War that democracy had triumphed, every 
state would soon adopt democracy, and war between states would end.

2018 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 1 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to be able to interpret an argument from a secondary 
source and identify examples of mass violence committed by totalitarian and democratic states that would 
either support or undermine the author’s argument. Additionally, students were expected to explain a 
development in the late twentieth century (post–World War II) that likely shaped the author’s view of the 
relationship between democracy and mass violence. The question addressed Key Concepts 5.2, 6.2, and 6.3 in 
the AP World History Curriculum Framework, the historical reasoning skill of Contextualization, and the 
Disciplinary Practice of Analyzing Historical Evidence (Secondary Sources). 

Sample: 1A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies mass starvation in the Soviet Union (“Russia”) resulting 
from Joseph Stalin's Five-Year Plans and collectivization as instances of mass violence committed by a 
totalitarian state in the twentieth century as an example that would support Rummel’s argument in the 
passage. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it explains that the Rwandan genocide occurred even though the 

government was democratic, thereby challenging Rummel’s argument that democratic states do not engage 
in mass violence. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains that United States political scientists such as Rummel 

would most likely have equated communism with totalitarianism and associated communist regimes such 
as Mao Zedong’s China with mass violence. 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because its discussion of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust is an example of mass 
violence committed by a totalitarian state in the twentieth century that would support Rummel’s argument 
in the passage. 

b) The response earned 1 point because its example of the British committing mass violence against the 

aboriginal people of Australia challenges Rummel’s argument in the passage. 

c) The response did not earn the point because the United States did not fight against Germany and Rwanda in 
the late twentieth century. These examples, therefore, would not have shaped Rummel’s view regarding the 
relationship between democracies, totalitarian states, and mass violence. 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

a) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the Holocaust in Nazi Germany as an example of a 
totalitarian state committing mass violence that would support Rummel’s argument in the passage.

Short Answer Question 1 (continued) 

b) The response did not earn the point because Serbia did not commit the Armenian genocide during World 

War I. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it does not sufficiently explain why the United States judicial 

system would have influenced Rummel’s view about the relationship between democracy and mass 
violence.
