Question 2 — Continuity/Change over Time 

Note: Essay does not have to address both

 beliefs and practices. 

BASIC CORE (competence)   

1.  Has acceptable thesis. 

0–7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis correctly specifies BOTH continuity and change in religion from 1450 to 

the present. 

•  Thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or the specified conclusion of 

the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or multiple sentences. 
•  A thesis that is split among multiple paragraphs or merely restates the prompt is 

unacceptable. For example, “There were many continuities and changes … ” is not 
acceptable.  

•  “Practices” is meant to be interpreted broadly (e.g., role of religion in politics). 
•  Beliefs and practices can be treated together. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count for any other point. 

2.  Addresses all parts of the question, though not necessarily evenly or  
      thoroughly. 

2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Essay addresses BOTH continuity AND change in religious beliefs and practices 

with historically relevant specificity.  

For 1 point: 
•  Addresses continuity OR change in religious beliefs and practices but not BOTH. 
•  “Addressing … ” CANNOT count as any other point. 

3.  Substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 

2 Points 

For 2 points: 
•  Provides at least five pieces of historically accurate evidence of continuity AND

change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices.  
o  Each piece of evidence must be a supporting example of continuity OR change 

in patterns of religious beliefs and practices. 

o  Examples: practice of indigenous religions in 1450 and its continuation; impact 
of monotheism in Latin America/Caribbean; end of human sacrifice in Latin 
America; spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa; introduction of Christianity to 
new areas of sub-Saharan Africa; less practice of indigenous religions. 

For 1 point: 
•  Partially substantiates thesis with appropriate historical evidence. 

o  Provides at least four pieces of accurate evidence
in patterns of religious beliefs and practices. 

 of continuity AND/OR change 

4.  Uses relevant world historic context effectively to explain continuity and  

change over time. 
•  Essay relates or describes extraregional (e.g., North Africa or Europe) connection or 

1 Point 

a global process (e.g., slave trade or expansion of trade networks) to explain 
continuity or change in patterns of religious beliefs and practices. 
o  Using “relevant world historical context” CANNOT count for the analysis point 

(#5) but can be included in the evidence count (#2), if appropriate.

2010 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2 

Overview 

This year’s question about continuity and change over time asked students to describe and explain 
continuities and changes in religious beliefs and practices in either sub-Saharan Africa or Latin 
America/the Caribbean from 1450 to the present. The intent of the question was to have students explain 
how those practices and beliefs changed, as well as how they remained the same, over a 550-year time 
period. Students needed to choose the region or continent about which they felt most knowledgeable. 
Further, students were asked to accurately explain a reason for or an impact of a continuity or change in 
patterns of religious beliefs and practices. Understanding of religious beliefs and practices is an important 
component of instruction in the AP World History course.  

Sample: 2A 
Score: 9 

The thesis appears in the first paragraph and accurately includes the time frame, specific changes and a 
continuity related to sub-Saharan Africa (1 point). The second paragraph of the essay addresses both 
change and continuity related to religious beliefs and practices (2 points). The essay includes many pieces 
of evidence, spread throughout the essay, supporting change and continuity (2 points). World historical 
context appears in many places with one example in the second sentence on page 2, “During the Berlin 
Conference of 1885, Africa was divided up between the European nations.” (1 point).  Analysis appears in 
the second paragraph (in the text beginning with “The reason for this change”) as well as in numerous 
other examples (1 point). The essay moved into the Expanded Core by demonstrating deep knowledge 
through the use of multiple pieces of evidence, demonstrating multiregional understanding, using 
sophisticated analyses, and providing many examples of world historical context (2 points).  

Sample: 2B 
Score: 5 

The thesis appears in the first paragraph relating change and continuity in religious beliefs and practices 
with Latin America during the period 1450–present (1 point). The essay addresses change in the second 
sentence of the second paragraph (1 point). Continuity related to religious practices and beliefs is not 
addressed. Four pieces of evidence of change are provided in the second paragraph (1 point) including 
one that references world historical context (1 point).  Analysis is addressed in the second paragraph in 
the text beginning with “Also the changes led to” (1 point). The essay summarizes world changes up to 
the present in the last paragraph but does not relate these changes to religious beliefs and practices or to 
Latin America. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 2 

A thesis is attempted but does not address continuity in Latin America. The first paragraph addresses 
change (1 point), and the third paragraph addresses continuity (1 point). There is one piece of accurate 
evidence of change in the third paragraph. The student attempts to provide additional evidence, but 
much of the material is historically inaccurate or not relevant to religious beliefs and practices.
