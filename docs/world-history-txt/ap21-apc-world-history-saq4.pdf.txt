General Scoring Notes 

3  points  

•  Each point is earned independently. 
•  Accuracy: These scoring guidelines require that students demonstrate historically defensible content 

knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, responses may contain errors that do not detract from 
their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate. 
•  Clarity: Exam responses should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. 

Those errors will not be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of 
the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below. 

•  Describe: Provide the relevant characteristics of a specified topic. Description requires more than simply 

mentioning an isolated term. 

•  Explain: Provide information about how or why a historical development or process occurs or how or 

why a relationship exists. 

(A) 

Identify ONE continuity in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 
1750–1900. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  A continuity in South and Southeast Asian politics was that many indigenous rulers 

continued to rule. 

•  One continuity in the politics of South and Southeast Asia was that Europeans 

continued to challenge the power of local rulers. 

•  One way in which there was continuity in South Asia was that the Mughal emperor 

remained the figurehead ruler of India until the British deposed him. 

•  Many rulers in India and Southeast Asia continued to rule by allying themselves with 

European powers. 

•  Through the middle of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company rather 

than the British government ruled many areas of India. 

(B) 

Identify ONE change in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 
1750–1900. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  One change in India was that the Mughal Empire collapsed. 
•  A significant change in the political order in Southeast Asia during this period was the 

arrival of the French, who proceeded to colonize Indochina. 

•  One major change during this period was that the British crown assumed direct rule 

over India following the Indian Rebellion in 1857. 

•  One change was that the Marathas established an empire in India.

•  One change was that European East India companies (British, Dutch, French, etc.) 

expanded their political power and transitioned into developing colonial governments. 

(C) 

Explain ONE way in which changes in the global economy led to changes in the political 
systems of South or Southeast Asia in the period 1750–1900. 

1  point  

Examples that earn this point include the following: 

•  One reason that the political systems of South and Southeast Asia changed was the 

• 

expansion and evolution of European empires. 
Industrialization in Europe fundamentally changed the political systems of South and 
Southeast Asia in this period because industrialization allowed Europeans to conquer 
and administer much of the region through superior weapons and ships. 

•  Because of deeper global economic integration and the establishment of European 
rule, many political elites in South Asia and Southeast Asia continued to hold their 
traditional political titles but lost all real political power and instead became wealthy 
landowners whose estates often produced raw materials for industrial factories in 
Europe. 

•  European states reacted to the development of the global capitalist economy by 
attempting to extract resources and open up markets by force and to create 
monopolies over trade with certain areas, which required gaining direct or indirect 
political control.

Short Answer Question 4 

Overview 

This question asked students to identify one continuity in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia in 
the period 1750–1900. Then students were asked to identify one change in the political systems of South or 
Southeast Asia during the period. Finally, they were asked to explain a way that changes in the global 
economy led to changes in the political systems of these regions during the period. The question primarily 
addressed Topics 4.5., 5.8., and 6.1. of the AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description. 

Sample: 4A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the continued role of the Brahmin caste in the Indian 
government. 

b) The response earned 1 point for identifying the change in colonial rule of India from British companies to 
“full British control.” The information about Gandhi in the response would not have earned the point because it 
is outside of the time period. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining how the demand for raw materials during industrialization led 
the British to “take control” in India, altering political systems there. 

Sample: 4B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point for identifying the political role of the caste system in India during the time 
period. 

b) The response did not earn a point because the separation of India and Pakistan occurred outside the time 
period. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining that Britain’s economy grew, and this development led to the 
British colonization of India and the change of political leadership there. 

Sample: 4C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn a point because the reference to the “control bigger powers had over the political 
systems” is not specific enough to identify a continuity in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia. 

b) The response did not earn a point because the reference to the “importance of trade” does not identify a 
change in the political systems of South or Southeast Asia. 

c) The response earned 1 point for explaining the “introduction of trading companies becoming more important 
in the political realm” and the reference to the Dutch East India Company (“Dutch indian Ocean company”).
