2007 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 2—Continuity/Change Over Time 

Overview 

Students were expected to trace and explain the changes and continuities from 1914 to the present in how 
peoples and their leaders in one of three regions (the Middle East, Southeast Asia, or sub-Saharan Africa) 
created either distinct or unique national identities, using evidence from specific countries. For example, 
what would make a nation-state Vietnamese or South African or Turkish throughout the twentieth 
century? 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 8 

The concluding paragraph serves as the thesis: the student focuses on the change of sub-Saharan African 
leaders, which gave people in the newly formed nation-states hope, but then the new leaders “ended as cruel 
military dictators.” Continuity for the thesis is evident in the mention of political divisions created by 
persistent European interference (1 point). Three pieces of change evidence are given: the Congo gaining 
independence from Belgium; the leadership of Nelson Mandela and his supporters leading to the end of 
apartheid in South Africa; and the establishment of a new South African government. The one piece of 
continuity evidence is the mention of the presence of white domination persisting after decolonization in 
South Africa (2 points). The same evidence also counted as addressing the question and received 2 points. 
Although the first paragraph lacks continuity and thus does not serve as the thesis, it does contain global 
context (1 point) and analysis of the colonies’ attitudes toward the European powers changing as a result of 
the World Wars (1 point). Another example of analysis is the student’s statement that sub-Saharan Africans 
recognized Europe’s weakened solidarity and increased vulnerability, increasing the Africans’ hopes for 
decolonization. The analysis in this essay is well above the basic core requirement, so with the expanded 
core point added, the final score was 8. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 4 

The thesis does not include continuity and therefore did not receive the thesis point. Change is addressed 
with the evidence of Vietnam becoming Communist, and continuity is addressed in the discussion of 
European political and economic influence and the cultural influence of China (2 points). Analysis is present 
in the reference to Vietnam being influenced by Chinese Communism (1 point). Global context is 
demonstrated in the student’s comments on the continued European influence on the politics of countries in 
Southeast Asia (1 point). The evidence specific to China, Japan, and North Korea received no points because 
those countries are not part of Southeast Asia. The final score was 4. 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

The thesis is incomplete. The essay does address change by mentioning the shift to more democracy in the 
Middle East (1 point), but there is no appropriate specific historical evidence, relevant world historical 
context, or analysis. Thus the final score was 1.
