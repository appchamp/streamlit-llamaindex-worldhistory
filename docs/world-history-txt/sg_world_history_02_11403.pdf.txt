Question 1 

BASIC CORE 

1)  Has acceptable thesis. 
The thesis must be explicit and based on the documents. It must deal with BOTH a comparison of the  
attitudes of Christianity and Islam and the change in the attitudes of each over time. The thesis may  
appear in any location, and the comparative and change over time components may be split and appear  
in different places. It may not be only a simple rewording of the question. 

1 Point 

2)  Uses all or all but 1 of the documents. 
May misinterpret documents and still receive the point. 

3)  Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from documents. 
Here students must address the issue of Change Over Time with appropriate grouping and/or  
interpretation of the documents. Students need not cite the document, but its use must be evident. The  
student must use the documents implicitly or explicitly to support the arguments for change over time.  
The treatment of Islam and Christianity need not be equal, but the discussion of change over time must  
include both. 
Some general groupings: 

•  Early Christianity condemns trade (Doc. 1, 3) 
•  Early Islam supports trade (Doc. 2) 
•  Both religions moderate their earlier positions over the period (Doc. 4-7) 

4)  Understands the basic meaning of documents cited in the essay. 
May misinterpret the content of no more than one document in a way that leads to an inaccurate  
grouping or a false conclusion. 

5)  Analyzes point of view or bias in at least 2 documents. 
Must show point of view in at least two documents by: 

•  Relating the author’s POV to the author’s religion, occupation, or time period OR 
•  Assessing the reliability of the source OR 
•  Recognizing that different kinds of documents serve different purposes OR 
•  Analyzing tone or intent of documents

Question 3 (cont’d.) 

EXPANDED CORE 

Expands beyond basic core of 1-6 points. A student must earn 6 points in the basic core  
area before earning points in the expanded core area. 

0-3 Points 

Examples: 

•  The essay has an exceptionally strong thesis (clear, analytical and comprehensive) that  
contrasts the responses of China and Japan to Western penetration in the 19th century. 

•  The essay thoroughly addresses all parts of the question. 
•  The essay provides more than two examples of historical evidence for either China or  

Japan to substantiate the thesis.

•  The essay shows similarities as well as differences in the Chinese and Japanese responses  

to Western penetration (breakdown of policies of isolation in both; popular uprisings in both). 

•  The essay goes beyond comparisons to thoroughly analyze by explaining and providing  

reasons for why China and Japan responded differently to Western penetration (the stronger  
tradition of cross-cultural borrowing in Japan; the greater political fluidity in semifeudal Japan  
of the late Tokugawa period as opposed to the continued strength of centralized rule in the  
late Qing).
