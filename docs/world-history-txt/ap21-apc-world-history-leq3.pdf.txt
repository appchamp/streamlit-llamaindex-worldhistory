Question 3: Long Essay Question, East and South Asian Economic Responses to Imperialism 

6 points 

General Scoring Notes 
•

Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence
without earning a point for thesis/claim.

• Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance
the argument is accurate.
Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a
student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.

•

In the period circa 1450–1750, European expansion affected the development of numerous East Asian and South Asian states. 

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the economies of East and/or South Asian states in this time period changed in response to 
European expansion.

Examples that earn this point: 

Do not focus on the topic of the prompt 
•

“The Ming dynasty remained the dominant economic power in
East Asia throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
even after the end of the Zheng He expeditions.”

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt 
•

“European expansion changed the economies of many parts of South and Southeast
Asia, as they increasingly produced goods that were sought after by European
merchants.”

South Asia and East Asia in both positive and negative ways.

Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic 
categories 
•

“While European expansion allowed European merchants to take an increasingly
greater role in facilitating regional trade, it did not significantly alter East Asian
economies because East Asian artisans, producers, and merchants retained the
dominant role in producing and distributing luxury goods.”

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•

Identify at least two specific historical examples relevant
to European expansion in Asia in the period 1450–1750.

Responses that earn 2 points: 
• Use at least two specific historical examples to

support an argument regarding how the economies
of East and/or South Asian states changed in
response to European expansion in the period
1450–1750.

Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include 
the following (two examples required): 
•

The Portuguese use of the cartaz system
The continued predominance of Arab, Gujarati, Javanese,
Chinese, and Omani merchants in regional trade
The global silver trade

The commercial and territorial expansion of European
joint-stock companies 

•

•

•

Example of a statement that earns one point for evidence: 
•

“The Portuguese used their superior sailing ship
technology and a system of passes for other countries’
merchant ships in an attempt to control the trade on the
Indian Ocean.”

•

Examples that successfully support an argument with 
evidence:  
•

“Despite the presence of European ships in the
Indian Ocean, the vast majority of seagoing trade
between Asian ports was still done by Asian ships
and sailors, such as the Gujaratis in the Arabian
Sea, and the Javanese around the Malay
peninsula.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of
evidence to support the argument that there were
limits to European impact on Asian economies) 
“The arrival of the European chartered companies
in India changed the balance of economic power.
These companies not only increasingly controlled
trade, but also began using their own armies to
wage war on Indian rulers.”  (Uses evidence to
support the argument that joint stock trading
companies changed Asian economies extensively) 

Additional Notes: 
•

Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.

•

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.
(For example, the continuing importance in the trade of textiles such as silk in the Mughal and Qing empires shows that the economies of South Asia and East
Asia did not change much because of European expansion; European expansion significantly changed the economies of South and East Asia because Europeans
became the middlemen of commerce.)

Responses that earn 1 point: 
• Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 
explain how the economies of East and/or South
Asian states changed in response to European
expansion in the period 1450–1750.

Responses that earn 2 points: 
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•
•

Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables.
Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes
and effects. 
Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across
periods.
Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple
perspectives across themes. 

•

•

• Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or

alternative views or evidence.

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•

Explaining the ways in which European expansion
affected specific East or South Asian economies. 
Explaining how East or South Asian merchants
changed their commercial practices to adapt to the
arrival of Europeans.
Explaining regional similarities and differences in
the economic impact of European expansion in
South or East Asian states. 

•

•

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
•
“The decline of Mughal authority in the 1700s,
combined with growing European military
superiority, allowed the British and French to seize
control of vital ports and gain control over Indian
trade. (Identifies both causation and references
change over time in the discussion of Europeans in
Mughal India) 

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•

Explaining the nuance of an issue by demonstrating how the arrival of
Europeans changed some parts of South or East Asian states’
economies significantly while affecting other parts minimally. For
instance, a response could discuss how Europeans established a
presence in Indian port cities and made significant changes to the
economies there but had a very limited impact on the interior of India
during this period. (Explains nuance, considers both causes and
effects, and qualifies an argument)
Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space,
such as explaining why the European arrival in the period 1450–1750
had a more minimal impact in South and East Asia than compared to
the activities of Europeans in the period 1750–1950. For instance, a
response could compare the Japanese limitations on European trade
into the port of Nagasaki in the Tokugawa period with the opening up
of Japan in the late 1800s and the westernization program and
industrial development of the Meiji period. (Explains relevant and
insightful connections)

• Qualifying an argument by demonstrating how the arrival of

•

Europeans led to minimal changes in the economies of multiple South
or East Asian states. For instance, a response could discuss the limited
European influence in some smaller Asian states such as Burma or
Thailand during this period in comparison to the effects on India,
Indonesia, and China. (Qualifies an argument) 
Corroborating an argument by demonstrating how the changes to the
economies of South or East Asian states as a result of the arrival of the
Europeans were connected to broader economic changes. For
instance, a response could analyze how the British East India
Company’s entry into the Asian opium trade affected the economies
of both India and China, or a response could analyze how growing
European demand for consumer goods such as tea or calico textiles
led to changes in the economy of South Asia during this period.
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•

This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

This question addressed Topic 4.4: Maritime Empires Established and Topic 4.5: Maritime Empires Maintained 
and Developed of the AP World History Curriculum and Framework. The question was open geographically to 
allow responses about multiple areas, with the main student responses focused on South Asia (India) and East 
Asia (China and Japan); however, areas in South East Asia were also accepted if presented correctly. The 
question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of European 
expansion on the countries located in South and East Asia, with a specific focus on economic impacts such as 
the choice to isolate from the global economy or the growing dependence on the European nations. Students 
were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the prompt, 
use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to support 
an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their argument, 
and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt. 
Students were able to use any historical thinking skill to demonstrate this understanding, and we saw 
successful responses that compared the impact of European expansion on two areas, discussed specific 
elements of European expansion along with their specific impacts, or evaluated the way impacts of European 
expansion changed over the time period provided.  

Sample: 3A 
Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 6 

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point at the end of the first paragraph by presenting a clear argument that European 
expansion lead to declines in manufacturing in South and East Asia: “Overall, this rise in European influence 
heavily impacted the economies of East and South Asia; many states resorted to isolating their economies from 
European influence, and manufacturing sectors drastically declined as people were exploited for other 
primarily agricultural sectors.” 

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point at the beginning of the first paragraph with a detailed and nuanced description 
of the motives and methods of European expansion. (“1450−1750 was marked by … to fuel their European 
nations’ export economies.”) 

C. Evidence (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point for extensive, specific evidence throughout. One example is the specific reference 
to the British East India Company and connection to its desire for cotton to fuel the British textile mills. 

The response earned the second evidence point for its repeated applications of evidence to arguments, for 
example, the role of Jesuit missionaries leading to Japan’s isolation, or the reference to European desire for 
luxury goods leading to European dissatisfaction with China’s isolation policies.

Question 3 — Long Essay Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned the point for historical reasoning through the use of historical reasoning skills in multiple 
arguments. One example is in the third paragraph, where the response presents multiple, cascading causes 
and effects of the British East India Company’s policy of arresting Indian economic development and turning 
India into a resource exporter. 

The response earned the point for demonstrating a complex understanding through sustained use of 
sophisticated and nuanced historical analysis. For example, the response demonstrates how the actions of 
smaller groups (like the Jesuit missionaries in Japan) could lead to large scale economic changes like the 
resulting isolation. The response also qualifies the argument by addressing how European expansion impacted 
economies in East Asia through isolation, while in South Asia the impact was more direct through controlling 
production. 

Sample: 3B 
Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 4 

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point in the introduction by stating that “European expansion greatly affected the 
economies in both East and South Asian states because they interferred with trade routes, kept invading, and 
spread new religions.” The response also has a second thesis in the conclusion, “[T]he expansion of European 
countries … greatly affected trade and the spread of new ideals and beliefs.” 

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 1 
The response earned the point for contextualization in the second paragraph. The response states that 
“European countries expanded into many Asian states that were weaker than them” and that Europeans were 
able to “take control.” This places economic change in Asia into the larger context of European expansion. 

C. Evidence (0−2 points): 2 
The response earned 1 point for citing the establishment of port cities and stating that “Japan actually closed 
off their country.” 

The response earned the second evidence point because it uses the two pieces of evidence to support 
arguments that “Europeans … were able to utilize the Asians’ trade routes while connecting to their own” and 
“Because of constant invasions, Japan actually closed off their country…” leading “Japan to fall behind.” 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the historical reasoning point. The response does not utilize historical reasoning to 
explain changes in South or East Asian economies. The attempt cites specific examples of changes without 
explaining the process of change in East or South Asian economies.  

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating complex understanding. There is no demonstrated 
attempt at complexity.

Sample: 3C 
Thesis: 0 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 1 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 1 

A. Thesis/Claim (0−1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point. The attempt in the first paragraph, “In the period ... Asain States” is a 
statement of fact but does not present a line of reasoning.  

B. Contextualization (0−1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point. There is no clear attempt at contextualization. 

C. Evidence (0−3 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point by identifying “the opium trade” and “luxury goods” as items traded in Asia.  

The response did not earn the point for supporting an argument with evidence because there is no clearly 
developed argument. 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0−2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning. The attempt to earn this point comes through a 
discussion of the opium trade as an effect of European exploration; however, these events occurred after the 
period indicated by the prompt. 

The response did not earn the point for demonstrating complex understanding. There is an attempt at 
connecting to another time period in the conclusion (“European expansion ... illegal drugs”), but it is neither
connected to the argument nor developed.
