Student Performance Q&A: 

2012 AP® World History Free-Response Questions 

The following comments on the 2012 free-response questions for AP® World History were written by 
the Chief Reader, Dean T. Ferguson of Texas A&M University–Kingsville. They give an overview of 
each free-response question and of how students performed on the question, including typical 
student errors. General comments regarding the skills and content that students frequently have the 
most problems with are included. Some suggestions for improving student performance in these 
areas are also provided. Teachers are encouraged to attend a College Board workshop to learn 
strategies for improving student performance in specific areas. 

Question 1 

What was the intent of this question? 

This question was intended to analyze the relationship between politics and the game of cricket in South 
Asia from 1880 to 2005. The question featured a rich variety of documents for students to use in their 
analysis. Rather than construing the term “politics” narrowly, the documents encouraged an interpretation 
of the political that extended beyond activities related simply to state functions or governmental 
institutions. The question invited responses that examined the role of cricket as a vehicle for articulating a 
variety of political aims, including British imperial objectives, emerging Indian nationalism, caste and 
religious rivalry, and competition between India and Pakistan. Most of the documents also provided helpful 
possibilities for discussions of point of view.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 2.45 out of a possible 9 points. 

In terms of the thesis, students were required to address a specific relationship between cricket and 
politics in South Asia. Merely stating that there were positive and negative aspects to the relationship was 
not sufficient, as students were expected to qualify their argument more clearly. Still, over half the students 
offered a successful thesis, a distinct improvement over last year. Students regularly scored 3 or 4 core 
points on these elements. 

Students generally addressed and understood all the documents. Though some documents were 
occasionally misinterpreted, there was no single document that was consistently misread or 
misunderstood. Most students were able to place the documents into three appropriate groups. Evidence 
was usually found in the documents, and many students received 2 points for identifying evidence in nine 
or 10 documents.

Many students analyzed the documents by grouping them in three or more groups, reflecting successful 
work on the part of teachers in explaining this skill to their students. Students interpreted the word 
“politics” in a broad sense. Therefore they adeptly identified uses of the 10 documents in many ways, 
including description of the politics of the caste system, the politics of religious division and unity, and the 
politics of developing nationalism in the face of British imperialism. One of the important ways in which 
the relationship between cricket and politics was analyzed was by effectively grouping the documents. 
Among the groups that students employed were the following: 

•  Unity within South Asia or India 
•  Unity between South Asia/India and Great Britain 
•  Relaxing of religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims 
•  Exacerbating religious tensions 
•  Breaking caste or ethnic barriers 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Although attempts at point of view (core point 4) continue to increase each year, only a minority of these 
were successful this year. Some students continue to merely identify a “bias” in a source, based primarily 
on attribution of the document, without qualifying why or how the particular identity of the source has 
informed the document’s tone or perspective. As in previous years, students were expected to situate the 
author or tone of the document. Having done this in some cases, students still did not provide an adequate 
rationale for their claim about perspective. 

As with point of view, more students are attempting to satisfy the requirement of suggesting an additional 
document (core point 6). However, most of the attempts were unsuccessful. Many envisioned a different 
document from those that were provided, but, as with the point-of-view point, they did not offer a 
substantial rationale for how that additional document would contribute to greater understanding of the 
relationship between cricket and politics. Attempts to identify point of view ought to refer back to a 
specific source, but the additional document must contribute to answering the specific prompt. In this 
case few students successfully linked their additional document idea to the relationship between cricket 
and politics in South Asia. 

Noticeable improvement has been made in thesis writing, and there is continued success in grouping, 
understanding, and using the documents for evidence. Improvement in the areas of point-of-view and 
additional document can be characterized as flat. 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

The essays revealed that teachers have succeeded in preparing their students to read and answer the 
question effectively, produce an acceptable thesis, and conduct good analysis of the documents. One 
minor suggestion is that students ought to be told to establish at least three document groups in their 
essays because this is likely to continue as an expectation.   

More critically, teachers would be well advised to devote more attention to explaining the point-of-view 
and additional-document requirements throughout the course. It is true that these skills, when attained, 
reflect a higher order of historical thinking that is not typical of all students. That said, it is likely that with 
continued instruction and reinforcement, these scores will improve on future document-based questions.  

Students should be encouraged to consider the perspective of all documents that they engage in the AP 
World History course. When writing practice essays, students could improve their performance on the 
additional document by conceiving of an additional document for each of their grouped paragraphs

because the grouping will be fresh in their mind and the paragraph can help serve as justification for the 
new document. In other words, each grouping implies either an evidentiary position, against which 
alternatives might be juxtaposed, or similar perspectives, again with an easily imagined alternative 
document, the explanation for which would naturally follow from the logic that sustained grouping those 
documents together in the first place.  

Question 2 

What was the intent of this question? 

The intent of this question was for students to identify and analyze continuity and change in trade 
networks between Africa and Eurasia during the time period circa 300 C.E. to 1450 C.E. Students were also 
expected to provide historical evidence to support a discussion of change and continuity in trade networks 
between the two regions and to explain change and continuity within a world historical context. 

The AP World History course is designed to support student learning of four key historical thinking skills, 
one of which is “the ability to recognize, analyze, and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and 
change over periods of time of varying length, as well as relating these patterns to larger historical 
processes or themes.” Additionally, AP World History is anchored by five course themes. Although this 
question aligns with many of them, it is explicitly aligned with Theme 4: Creation, Expansion, and 
Interaction of Economic Systems. This question provided an opportunity for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of historical content and the application of historical thinking skills.  

How well did students perform on this question? 

The mean score was 2.02 out of a possible 9 points. 

Students demonstrated considerable knowledge of trade networks in Africa and Eurasia (i.e., trans-
Saharan trade routes, Silk Roads, Indian Ocean trade routes) and some knowledge of goods, ideas, and 
technologies transmitted along these trade networks. Some essays contained sophisticated discussions of 
trade networks between Africa and Eurasia in the specified time period that demonstrated student 
understanding of the process of change and continuity over time in trade networks between the two 
regions, the world historical context of those changes and continuities, and analyses of causes and 
consequences. Unfortunately, many responses were comparisons of networks in each region (similarities 
and differences between the regional trade networks) rather than analyses of changes and continuities in 
trade networks between the regions. Additionally, many responses did not contain an effective discussion 
of change and continuity over time within a world historical context or analysis of the process of change 
and continuity. Many essays also included evidence and discussions of historical events outside of the 
specified time period. 

What were common student errors or omissions?  

One of the most common errors was not addressing all parts of the question. Many students focused 
exclusively on changes in trade networks between the regions, with little attention to continuities. 
Additonally, many students analyzed change and continuity in trade networks in the regions without 
making explicit connections between regions. There were also many responses that compared trade 
networks in Eurasia to trade networks in Africa. 

Many students restated the prompt as their thesis, pointedly including the word “between” in the thesis 
but without stating specific changes and continuities in trade networks between regions. If students did 
not address the prompt in the thesis, this often, but not always, meant that they did not address all parts of 
the question in other parts of their response. For students to earn 1 point for thesis and 2 points for

addressing the question, they had to specify at least one change and one continuity in trade networks 
between the two regions within the specified time period. 

The vast majority of responses generally acknowledged the growth and development of Indian Ocean and 
trans-Saharan trade networks during this time period. Students often referenced the Silk Road trade routes 
but did not connect them explicitly to other trade routes leading to Africa (between regions). Some 
students connected Eurasian Silk Roads to Mediterranean Sea trade (Eurasian-African connection). 
Students often made reference to goods traded (gold, salt, slaves, spices) but did not demonstrate that they 
had knowledge of where particular trade goods originated and where they diffused through trade.  

In general, students provided historical evidence that demonstrated they had a generic knowledge of trade 
networks, political and technological developments, religions, and trade goods in Eurasia and Africa, but 
few students demonstrated they could use that evidence to support a discussion or analysis of change and 
continuity in trade networks between the two regions in the specified time period. 

This year, as in previous years, most students struggled with analysis. Many essays did not sufficiently 
analyze change and continuity across the entirety of the specified time period. Some students attempted 
to turn a statement of evidence into analysis of change or continuity. For example, trade networks 
contributed to the growth and strength of empires in the regions. Such analysis, however, was insufficient 
to qualify for a point because it did not specify how changes or continuities in trade networks contributed 
to such growth.  

Very few essays recognized the spread of Christianity into East Africa. Students frequently mentioned the 
transmission or cultural diffusion of Islam into Africa and the rise of Islamic empires (700–1450 C.E.), but 
they often neglected to mention or reference the earlier collapse of the Roman Empire. Additionally, many 
responses contained sweeping generalizations about regions and identified Eurasia or Africa as a country 
or nation rather than recognizing the nuanced nature of historical experiences within each region.  

In general, issues related to periodization, chronology, and geography seemed to be the primary sources of 
errors in relation to this question. Many students included historical evidence that was not only out of the 
specified time period but also out of the specified regions (e.g., discussion of trans-Atlantic slave trade, the 
Columbian Exchange, 19th-century imperialism, triangle trade routes, industrialization). 

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Teachers should pay particular attention to teaching students to attack the question before they begin 
writing their responses. This year many students seemed to miss or ignore the word “between” in the 
prompt and wrote essays that may have addressed change and continuity in trade networks in Africa and 
Eurasia but not between them. There were also many essays that compared trade networks in each region. 
Teachers should encourage students to read the prompt carefully and perhaps rewrite it word-by-word or 
circle key words. This strategy encourages students to focus on what the prompt is asking them to address 
and is fundamentally useful for all learners.  

Teachers should continue to reinforce student understanding of periodization and chronology. Classroom 
strategies that support student learning about change and continuity over time include using timelines 
and creating change/continuity tables. Drawing on the curriculum framework, teachers should encourage 
students to create graphic organizers that will help them display the big picture globally, in relation to the 
main course themes, and simultaneously take notes on the illustrative examples or historical evidence of 
those themes.

One approach may be to have students create change/continuity tables for each time period and each 
theme. For example, during a unit that covers the period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E., students might be required to 
identify, describe, and analyze changes and continuities in each of the five course themes. An activity or 
assignment like this may also be constructed to provide opportunities for students to work in cooperative 
learning groups; small groups may be assigned different themes and collaborate to complete the 
assignment. Each group could be required to create a poster with that information that could be displayed 
in the room for the remainder of the year and serve as a study tool later during review. If teachers engaged 
students in this type of activity during a unit, summative assessments at the end of the unit might include 
a change-and-continuity-over-time essay modeled after those used on previous exams. 

Teachers should also continue to help students understand change and continuity within the context of 
world historical processes and to develop analytical writing skills. Teachers may want to practice this skill 
in isolation in the classroom to help prepare students do this well on the exam. In relation to the 
assignment referenced above, teachers could have students present their change/continuity posters to the 
class and then engage the class in a discussion of the world historical context for the change/continuity as 
well as the reasons for and consequences of the change/continuity. This activity could even be staged as a 
game or as a formative assessment.  

The key is to create opportunities for students to learn historical content and develop these historical 
thinking and writing skills. Teachers should use essay questions from previous exams (available on AP 
Central®) in class as often as possible at appropriate intervals. There are many past change-and-continuity-
over-time questions that can be used to either teach content or to assess student understanding at the end 
of units. Each essay question has an operational scoring guide that accompanies it as well as sample 
student essays. Assigning the questions to students and using the scoring guides to provide feedback to 
students is one of the best ways to support the development of historical and analytical writing skills. 
Analysis is an enduring skill in the AP World History course, and learning how to prepare students to think, 
read, and write analytically should continue to be the focus of teacher professional development.  

Question 3 

What was the intent of this question? 

The intent of this question was for students to identify and explain similarities and differences in the 
demographic and environmental effects of the Columbian Exchange from 1492 to 1750 on two regions: the 
Americas and either Asia, Africa, or Europe. Students were required to choose one of three regions (Asia, 
Africa, or Europe) to compare and contrast with the Americas. The question was intended to assess 
students’ knowledge of Key Concept 4.1.V, including each of the subpoints A through E. It was also 
intended to assess students’ historical thinking skills, particularly comparison and contextualization  
(skill 3), and their thematic understanding of Period 4 (1450–1750), particularly as it relates to theme 1, 
interaction between humans and the environment.  

How well did students perform on this question?  

The mean score was 1.63 out of a total possible of 9 points.   

The majority of students were familiar with the Columbian Exchange. As a result, most students wrote 
substantive essays for this question, even if many of them were not actually responsive to the prompt. 
Many students were able to describe the Columbian Exchange, explain the economic and commercial 
impacts, or link the Columbian Exchange with the rise of colonial power in the Americas. However, fewer 
students were able to write a response focused on the Columbian Exchange’s demographic and 
environmental effects. Although students could identify environmental effects relating to changes in crops 
and the expansion of plantation systems of agricultural production, the term “demographic” seemed to

throw off many students. Nevertheless, most students familiar with the topic knew to write about the  
slave trade as an integral part of the Columbian Exchange and earned credit for addressing demographics 
as a result. 

Excellent student responses included a clear thesis statement and repeated direct statements of similarity 
and difference. Essays earning the top scores were also able to provide a depth of nuanced analysis 
showing the interrelated nature of regional exchanges, whereas the analysis in the midrange essays 
usually relied on more generic reassertions of the Columbian Exchange metanarrative of disease impacts 
in the Americas or the impacts of the increase of calorie-rich food in Europe. Similarly, lower midrange 
essays relied on more generic evidence, but essays that scored better offered plentiful specific and 
concrete evidence for their explanations, often citing and explaining specific diseases or crops.  

Many students did not attempt this question or made extremely short attempts, indicating that they did 
not manage their time well. However, students with clear familiarity with the topic answered this question 
first or second and generated lengthy responses.   

What were common student errors or omissions?  

Overall the most common error was writing what the students knew about the Columbian Exchange rather 
than addressing the focus areas of the question. Many students described colonization in the Americas or 
the commercial trade and never addressed the demographic or environmental effects. This may have been 
a factor of the students’ familiarity with the topic, but it also demonstrates students’ overall inability to 
parse the prompt before jumping into the writing.  

Not generating a clear and comprehensive thesis statement was a second common error. Of course, 
without parsing the prompt first, the ability to generate a thesis responding to the prompt is difficult, but 
students also had difficulty crafting a strong thesis statement that included similarities and differences 
and did not rely on vague generalities like “positive and negative” or “beneficial and harmful” or a very 
weak assertion of “both.” Very few thesis statements were analytic.  

A third common error was not writing clear and direct statements of similarity and difference. Many 
students with good topic knowledge lacked the skills necessary to write statements that drew similarities 
or differences directly. Although this is a fundamental skill in the course, many students have not 
practiced enough to develop knowledge of the writing mechanics necessary to explicitly articulate the 
similarities or differences. Higher-scoring essays all demonstrated ease with the vocabulary of drawing 
direct statements (e.g., “unlike,” “by contrast,” “whereas,” “analogous,” “parallel,” “matching,” 
“equivalent”), but the language of comparison was almost uniformly absent from lower-performing essays.  

Other common errors included not drawing exclusively from the period. For example, many students 
included the environmental effects of industrialization or the effects of the Black Death as central parts of 
their essays despite the fact that these are both clearly outside the time frame established by the question. 
Similarly, some essays included long descriptions of Native American populations and civilizations prior to 
the arrival of European explorers.  

Based on your experience of student responses at the AP Reading, what message would you 
like to send to teachers that might help them to improve the performance of their students on 
the exam?  

Teachers should devote more direct instruction to practice parsing the prompt (attacking the question) 
with students as often as possible to develop the skills of deconstructing the language of the prompt to 
identify the tasks required as well as the content expectations. This is especially significant as the first 
step in teaching students to develop the structure of the essay before they begin writing.

Teachers should devote more direct instruction to the mechanics of writing explicit statements of 
similarity and difference. Students should brainstorm and then memorize and practice using comparative 
vocabulary. This vocabulary can be reinforced periodically in reading quizzes, quick-write activities, or 
daily summaries and wrap-up activities so that students develop a facility with its use. Teachers should 
reinforce the idea that statements of similarity should show, not tell. That is, comparative statements 
should not indicate the comparative category or where to find a similarity in the information (e.g., “The 
similarities in X and Y are in the population changes”) but should lay out the difference or similarity 
explicitly for the reader (e.g., “The populations of Native Americans decreased, whereas the populations of 
Europe increased”).    

In teaching the expectations of the comparative essay to their students, teachers should emphasize a 
structure for the comparative essay that forces students to develop the ability to craft explicit statements 
of similarities and differences. Teachers should require that essays include topic sentences for each body 
paragraph that are explicit statements of comparison and contrast.   

In writing practice essays, students should be strongly discouraged from relying on the word “both” to 
indicate similarities because too often they do not construct a statement that truly applies to both sides of 
the comparison. Students can practice writing explicit statements of similarity and difference in activities 
that do not involve writing a complete essay. Also, students should be strongly discouraged from writing 
comparisons that rely on generic qualifications (e.g., positive for Europe and negative for Africa).
