Source: Adapted from Tim Jackson, Prosperity Without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet (London: Earthscan, 2009), p. 56. 

*a measurement of a country’s economic production in a given year 

a) Identify ONE way that the data in the chart illustrate global economic differences between countries in the 
late twentieth century.

of the world’s countries, as displayed in the chart. 

c) Explain ONE way in which longer life expectancies in some of the world’s countries, as displayed in the 
chart, have led to new political, economic, or social problems.

Scoring Guide 

0–3 points 

•  ONE point for identifying one way that the data in the chart illustrate global economic differences 

between countries in the late twentieth century 

•  ONE point for identifying one similarity (other than GDP per capita) that might account for the low life 

expectancies of some of the world’s countries, as displayed in the chart 

•  ONE point for explaining one way in which longer life expectancies in some of the world’s countries, 

as displayed in the chart, have led to new political, economic, or social problems 

Scoring Notes 

Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit: 

•  The data show that the United States has a higher GDP than Swaziland. 
•  The chart shows that developed countries have higher life expectancies than underdeveloped 

countries. 

•  The chart shows that people in developed economies in the West and Asia live longer than people in 

underdeveloped countries because they have better access to modern medicine and vaccines. 

Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit: 

•  Poor water and food quality contribute to the low life expectancies in some of the countries shown in 

the chart. 

•  Formerly colonized countries shown in the chart might find it difficult to improve sanitation 

infrastructure and medical care because of economic imperialism. 

•  The lack of access to quality medical care and vaccines is a reason for the low life expectancies in 

some of the countries shown in the chart, particularly with the emergence of epidemic diseases such as 
AIDS and malaria. 

Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit: 

•  Countries with long life expectancies have people who are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, 

which strains the healthcare system. 

•  Longer life expectancies in the countries shown in the chart have led to an increased economic burden 

• 

on a decreasing population of working-age citizens, creating social and political tensions. 
In Western European countries such as Norway and the United Kingdom, longer life-expectancy rates 
have created political controversy as a result of those governments’ commitment to social welfare 
programs.

2019 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Short Answer Question 2 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

For this short-answer question, students were expected to analyze the data in the chart to identify global 
economic differences between countries and identify a factor that might account for low life expectancy at birth 
in some of the countries displayed on the chart. Furthermore, students needed to explain how longer life 
expectancy in some countries has led to political, social, or economic challenges. Students were expected to 
demonstrate the ability to analyze data and the understanding of the relationship between the global economy 
in the late twentieth century and shifting demographic, political, and social trends. The question addressed 
Key Concepts 6.1 and 6.3 in the AP World History Curriculum Framework and the historical reasoning skills of 
Comparison and Causation. 

Sample: 2A 
Score: 3 

a) The response earned 1 point because it uses the data in the chart to identify the difference in life expectancy 
between countries in the “Global North” that have higher GDPs and countries in the “Global South” that 
have lower GDPs. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the presence of tropical diseases, like malaria, as a factor 

that accounts for low life expectancy in some countries. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains how countries with long life expectancy may experience an 

unbalanced ratio of working age and elderly retiree populations that creates an economic strain due to 
increasing demands for social welfare programs, including healthcare, which require greater taxation to 
support. 

Sample: 2B 
Score: 2 

a) The response earned 1 point because it uses the chart to identify the economic differences between 
developing postcolonial African countries that lack resources and economically developed Western 
countries that benefitted from imperialism. 

b) The response earned 1 point because it identifies the corruption and poverty experienced by postcolonial 

countries as they became independent as a factor that may account for low life-expectancy rates. 

c) The response did not earn the point because it does not explain how an increased elderly population has led 
to a higher cost of living and slow population growth in wealthier countries such as Japan and the United 
Kingdom.

Short Answer Question 2 (continued) 

Sample: 2C 
Score: 1 

a) The response did not earn the point because it explains how GDP is used but does not use the data in the 

chart to identify an economic difference between life-expectancy rates of the countries included in the chart. 

b) The response did not earn the point because it does not identify a specific way in which a history of 

colonization contributes to low life expectancy in some countries as displayed in the chart. 

c) The response earned 1 point because it explains the issue of providing income and healthcare for aging 

populations and the resulting economic strain for countries that have long life-expectancy rates.
