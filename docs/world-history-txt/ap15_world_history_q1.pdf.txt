Question 1 

BASIC CORE (competence) 

1. Has acceptable thesis. 

0-7 Points 

1 Point 

•  The thesis must address TWO RESPONSES to the spread of influenza in the 

early 20th century plausibly drawn from the documents.   

•  The thesis must be explicitly stated in the introduction or specified conclusion of 

the essay. 

•  The thesis may appear as one sentence or as multiple consecutive sentences. 
•  A thesis that merely restates the prompt is unacceptable. 
•  The thesis CANNOT count in any other category.  

2. Understands the basic meaning of documents.  

1 Point 

•  Students must address ALL NINE of the documents.  
•  Students must demonstrate an understanding of the basic meaning of AT LEAST 

EIGHT documents.  

•  Students may demonstrate understanding of the basic meaning of a document by 

grouping it in regard to A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza.  

•  Merely restating verbatim or quoting the content of the documents without 

context does not adequately demonstrate an understanding of basic meaning. 

3. Supports thesis with appropriate evidence from all or all but one document.  

1-2 Points 

For 2 points: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza. Must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of eight documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

For 1 point: 

•  Specific and accurate evidence of A RESPONSE to the spread of influenza. Must 

be explicitly drawn from a minimum of seven documents.  

•  A document that is simply listed does not count as using the document as 

evidence.  

4. Analyzes point of view in at least two documents. 
Students must correctly analyze point of view in AT LEAST TWO documents.  

•  Point of view explains why this individual might have this opinion or what feature 

informs the author’s point of view. 

•  Students must move beyond mere description by explaining a document’s tone, 
the characteristics of the author, the intended audience, or how the intended 
outcome may have influenced the author’s opinion (or some combination of these). 

•  Students may challenge the veracity of the author’s opinion or point of view, but 

they must move beyond a mere statement that the author is “biased” by providing 
some plausible analysis of how or why. 

•  Mere attribution is not sufficient. Attribution is copying or repeating information 

verbatim from the source line of the document.

•  An extended discussion of a minimum of two documents (used appropriately) 

constitutes a group or subgroup.  

6. Identifies and explains the need for one type of appropriate additional 
    document or source.

2015 SCORING COMMENTARY 

Question 1 

Overview 

The document-based question (DBQ) directly addresses Curriculum Framework Key Concept 6.1 (Science 
and the Environment). The 1918 Influenza Pandemic is specifically identified as one of the illustrative 
examples in Section III (Disease, scientific innovations, and conflict led to demographic shifts).  

Students were asked to analyze the varied responses to the 1918–1919 Influenza Pandemic in the nine 
documents. The nine documents lent themselves to comparing responses to the pandemic in various 
places around the world as well as responses from persons of varied roles and socioeconomic backgrounds. 
These responses included volunteering to help the sick, isolation or quarantine to prevent infection, 
paralysis or lack of action, and arriving at the belief that the pandemic was caused by divine intervention. 
These four responses became the basis for the most common groupings, though other groupings included 
blaming the government, fear, and demoralization among others.  

The documents provided ample basis for a thorough response to the prompt. The details, coupled with the 
clear language in the documents, made their effective use as evidence and support for analysis 
straightforward. Each of the nine documents offered at least one clearly identifiable response that could be 
paired with a response in another document, though many documents had more than one pairing option. 
Most of the document attributions gave ample grounds for students to use as a basis for analyzing the 
point of view of the source. The language used in many of the documents also provided a means of 
analyzing point of view by evaluating tone. Although some students had difficulty with document 5 due to 
lack of familiarity with the ideology of Christian Scientists, many were still able to make full use of the 
document, including its tone.  

Sample: 1A 
Score: 9 

The thesis of this essay is found in consecutive sentences in the introduction where the student identifies 
three responses (1 point). All nine documents are addressed in the essay, and the student demonstrates an 
understanding of all nine (1 point). The student also draws evidence of a response to the influenza epidemic 
from all nine documents (2 points). The essay has three analyses of point of view. The emotional point of view 
of the medical doctor in document 1 is explained, as is the colonial perspective of the student of the report in 
document 3. The essay also explains the qualifications of the testimonies in document 7 as based on the 
women’s recollection of events that occurred 50 years earlier (1 point). The topic sentences create three 
groups of documents effectively. The first groups documents 4, 5, and 8 around the belief in the divine cause 
of the epidemic. The second groups documents 1, 2, and 7 on the response of volunteering. The third groups 
documents 3, 6, and 9 on the responses of governments (1 point). There are three successful requests for 
additional documents, one at the end of each paragraph grouping of documents, and each supplies an 
explanation for the requested source (1 point). Two expanded core points were earned by the quality of the 
analysis of multiple documents, the additional analysis of point of view, the extra requests for an additional 
document, and the strong organization of the information and structure of the argument (2 points).

Question 1 (continued) 

Sample: 1B 
Score: 5 

The essay does not provide an adequate thesis. The statement at the end of the introductory paragraph 
does not clearly articulate responses. The student addresses and demonstrates a basic understanding of all 
nine documents (1 point). The essay identifies evidence of a response in all nine documents (2 points). 
There is no successful analysis of point of view in the essay. The attempt to analyze the point of view in 
document 7 does not move beyond identifying the documents as “childhood flashbacks,” while the 
attempt for document 8 is only attribution of the source as soldiers. There are three groupings in the essay. 
The essay groups documents 1 and 3 as opposites in the category of care for the sick, documents 4 and 5 
based on the belief that the epidemic was a divine punishment, and documents 6 and 9 based on the lack 
of response of governments (1 point). In the final paragraph, the additional document request and reason 
for the additional source is excellent (1 point). 

Sample: 1C 
Score: 1 

There is no adequate thesis in either the introductory paragraph or the final sentence of the essay. Only 
one response is identified, influence on one’s religious outlook. The student addresses and demonstrates a 
basic understanding of all nine documents (1 point). The essay identifies a response in documents 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and 8 only and therefore earned no points. The essay makes no attempts at point-of-view analysis. 
There are only two groups of documents. The essay groups documents 1 and 2 around the response of 
increasing medical staffing and documents 4, 5, and 8 around the response of changing religious outlook.  
The essay does not include a request for an additional document.
