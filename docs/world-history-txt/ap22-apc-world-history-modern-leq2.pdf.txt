Question 2: Long Essay Question, Pre-Columbian States 

6 points  

General Scoring Notes 
•  Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn a point for evidence 

without earning a point for thesis/claim. 

•  Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed 

nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality, as long as the historical content used to advance 
the argument is accurate. 

•  Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a 

student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.  

In the period before circa 1500, states in the Americas used a variety of institutions, policies, and practices to consolidate and expand their scope and 
reach.  

Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which ONE pre-Columbian state in the Americas was successful in consolidating and centralizing its 
authority during this period.

“The Mexica developed centralized religious and 
tributary systems to exert control over their clients, 
allies, and conquered peoples. Their monuments, 
human sacrifices, and bureaucracies helped them 
rule an expansive empire.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence to support the argument 
regarding how one pre-Columbian state in the 
Americas was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing its authority) 
“One way the Inca were able to rule over such a 
vast empire was through the use of roads such as 
the Carpa Nan which spanned the entirety of the 
Inca Empire and allowed for efficient transport, 
trade, and communication.” (Uses multiple, specific 
pieces of evidence to support the argument 
regarding how one pre-Columbian state in the 
Americas was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing its authority) 

• 

Additional Notes: 
•  Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.  
• 

If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and 
another example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.  
(For example, discussion of the development of the Aztec tribute system; the development of the Inca management of their road system)

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes 

Scoring Criteria 

Responses that do not 
earn points: 
•  May include evidence 
but offer no reasoning
to connect the 
evidence to an 
argument. 

•  May assert the use of 

historical reasoning but 
does not use it to 
frame or structure an 
argument. 

Examples that do not earn 
points:  

Provide evidence but offer 
no reasoning to connect 
the evidence to an 
argument: 

• 

“The Incan Empire 
developed a large 
system of roads.” 

Responses that earn 1 point: 
•  Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to 

explain how ONE pre-Columbian state in the 
Americas was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing its authority. 

Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an 
argument could include: 
•  Explaining how the expansion of empires such as 
the Aztecs resulted in conflict between competing 
kingdoms and ethnic groups.  
Explaining how the decentralization of Mayan city-
states limited the ability of rulers to consolidate 
their administrations. 

• 

•  Explaining increased centralization led to the 

creation of large monuments and the collection of 
precious metals and jewelry.  

Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning: 
• 

“Aztec rulers used warfare and tribute collection to 
amass wealth that allowed them to build 
monuments to show their authority.” (Establishes a 
development that contributed to the centralization 
of pre-Colombian states in the relevant period. This 
statement would need to be followed up with at 
least minimal discussion of the development 
introduced.) 

Responses that earn 2 points:  
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables. 
•  Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity 
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes 
and effects. 
Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across 
periods. 

• 

•  Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple

perspectives across themes. 

•  Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or 

alternative views or evidence.  

Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the 
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided: 
•  Explaining the nuance of an issue by showing that the Mayan city 

states were prevented from consolidating a large empire through a 
combination of environmental challenges such as major droughts as 
well as competition from neighboring states. (Explains nuance, 
considers both causes and effects, and qualifies an argument) 

•  Explaining relevant and insightful connections across time and space, 

such as demonstrating how the Incan and Aztec empire both 
expanded their states through a combination of conquest and political 
alliances, such as the alliance between major Aztec cities. (Explains 
relevant and insightful connections) 

•  Qualifying an argument by demonstrating that while the mound 
building culture of the Mississippi River Valley built numerous 
monuments, there is limited evidence demonstrating centralized 
administration. (Qualifies an argument) 

•  Corroborating an argument by demonstrating how the Iroquois 

confederation’s formation and expansion was a direct response to 
European colonial expansion into Canada and the Ohio River Valley.  
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects) 

Additional Notes: 
•  This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Question 2—Long Essay Question 2 

Note: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors. 

Overview 

Responses to the Long Essay Question 2 (LEQ 2) asked students to evaluate the extent to which one 
pre-Columbian state in the Americas was successful in consolidating its authority during the period 
before 1500. Students were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical 
context relevant to the prompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of 
the prompt, use that evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt, use historical 
reasoning skills to frame or structure their argument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the 
historical development that is the focus of the prompt. Successful responses that compared pre-
Columbian states’ consolidation explained the reason for successful or unsuccessful consolidation, or 
discussed how consolidation continued and ended in the period. 

Sample: 2A 
Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 1 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 2 

Total Score: 6 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim in the last sentence of the introductory paragraph: “The 
Incas, for example, were successful to a great extent in consolidating and centralizing their authority 
during this period by the creation of infrastructure that connected their empire, and by using religion 
to justify rule.” 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for contextualization in the introductory paragraph. The response 
explains how “growing trade networks and maritime technology” led to “Spanish state-sponsored 
exploration across the Atlantic.” 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points for evidence by providing several specific pieces of evidence about the 
Inca Empire and connecting them to arguments concerning Inca governance. In the second 
paragraph the response argues that the Carpa Nan (road network) was an example of “state 
sponsored infrastructure” that Inca rulers used in “boosting the economy, helping consolide and 
centralizing their authority.” In the third paragraph the response argues that Inca rulers used religion 
“as a justification to rule,” “as rulers are said to be related to the Great Sun”). A third piece of 
evidence describing the use of human sacrifice (in the Aztec and Inca Empires) for religious reasons 
is also included in the third paragraph. Finally, in the fourth paragraph the response argues that 
“quipu, a specialized method recording quantitative data” enabled the Inca to be “affective at 
governing over the entirety of the territory.

Question 2—Long Essay Question (continued) 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 2 

Using Historical Reasoning 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning. The response explains how the use of religion 
as a justification to rule was a continuity in the Americas. 

Demonstrating Complex Understanding 
The response earned 1 point for complexity because it includes complex comparative argumentation 
and extensive use of evidence to corroborate the arguments. The response includes numerous 
additional (non-Inca) examples as comparison: the Mandate of Heaven, the Divine Rights of Kings, 
Cahokia and Pueblo culture, Aztec tribute system, Aztec chinampas, and Maya astronomical 
discoveries. 

Sample: 2B 
Thesis: 1 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 2 
Analysis and Reasoning: 1 

Total Score: 4 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for thesis/claim in the last sentence of the introductory paragraph with 
an acceptable claim that establishes a line of reasoning: “However, the Aztec empire was the 
strongest pre-Columbian state in the Americas, through us of human sacrifices, large, impressive 
temples, and a consolidation of power used to expand their reach throughout South America before 
circa 1500.” The placement of the Aztec Empire in South America is factually incorrect but does not 
disqualify the response from earning the thesis point. 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The first two sentences of the introductory 
paragraph attempt placing pre-Columbian states in a broader context, but they are too vague and 
overgeneralized.” 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 2 
The response earned 2 points for evidence. Each of the three body paragraphs is organized around a
distinct piece of evidence (human sacrifice, monumental temples, and the divine claims of the ruler) 
and connects that piece of evidence to an argument about the success of the Aztec Empire in 
consolidating and expanding its rule.  

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 1 
The response earned 1 point for historical reasoning. The response successfully explains the causal 
links between Aztec practices, such as human sacrifice, and religious beliefs, such as the belief that 
rulers were divinely chosen, and the success of the Aztec empire in consolidating its rule and 
expanding into new territories.

Question 2—Long Essay Question 2 (continued) 

The response did not earn the point for complexity. The response does not expand beyond the core 
evidence of Aztec governance and religious practices and does not show a complex understanding 
either by exploring nuance or by comparisons between the Aztec Empire and other pre-Columbian 
states. 

Sample: 2C 
Thesis: 0 
Contextualization: 0 
Evidence: 1 
Analysis and Reasoning: 0 

Total Score: 1 

A. Thesis/Claim (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for thesis/claim. The response attempts a thesis in the beginning 
of the essay: “One pre-Columbian state in the Americas that was successful in consolidating and 
centralizing their power before circa 1500 was the Myans. They were successful in consolidating and 
centralizing their authority through military power.” While this does establish a line of reasoning, it 
is not a historically defensible claim because the Maya were a society of decentralized city-states. 
Further in the paragraph, the response states that Maya “centralized their power through city states,” 
where “each city had a mini ruler in place that would listen / take orders from the king whom lived in 
their capital city.” While this description is reminiscent of the tributary arrangements between major 
and minor Maya city states, it again suggests that the response is arguing, inaccurately, that the 
Maya were organized in a politically centralized manner. 

B. Contextualization (0–1 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for contextualization. The response did not attempt to describe a 
broader historical development relevant to the prompt. 

C. Evidence (0–2 points): 1 
While the information presented in the paragraph was not enough to earn the thesis point, some of it 
was sufficiently accurate to earn 1 point for evidence. Examples include the mention of Maya use of 
war captives in human sacrifices to the gods, the mention of “city states,” and the reference to local 
“mini ruler(s)” taking their orders from a higher ranking “king.” 

D. Analysis and Reasoning (0–2 points): 0 
The response did not earn the point for historical reasoning. The response does not accurately 
describe the causal connections between Maya political or religious practices and state consolidation 
or expansion. 

The response did not earn the point for complexity. There is no attempt to demonstrate a complex 
understanding of how the Maya consolidated or expanded their power.
