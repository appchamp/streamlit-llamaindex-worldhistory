“While the world revolution of Westernization [after 1850] created a political world order radically different 
from all past human experience, it also disrupted the non-Western societies constituting the bulk of humanity. 
. . . The Westerners with their sense of mission also introduced their education. Along the way 
[Western-educated intellectuals from non-Western societies] soon acquired a taste for the dominant ideals of 
the West, especially the liberal plea for equality, freedom, and self-determination and the socialists’ cry for 
social justice for all exploited and oppressed peoples and classes. . . .  

Inevitably, the non-Western intellectuals turned their lessons to their own use. The ideals of freedom and 
self-determination justified protests over the humiliation of their countries and cultures. As a result of their 
Westernization they became anti-Western nationalists, caught in a love-hate attitude toward the West. . . .  

The world revolution of Westernization perpetuated inequality and ruinous cultural subversion while at the 
same time improving the material conditions of life.” 

Theodore von Laue, historian, The World Revolution of Westernization, 
1987 

1.  a) Identify ONE non-Western nationalist leader whose actions might be used to illustrate the author’s argument 

in the passage. 

b) Explain ONE way in which the “world revolution of Westernization” identified by von Laue in the passage 
disrupted non-Western societies. 

c) Explain ONE reason why historians in the late twentieth century reinterpreted Western imperialism in the 
way that von Laue does in the second and third paragraphs of the passage.

Document 1 

Source: Matías Romero Avendaño, finance minister in the government of President Porfirio Díaz, letter to 
Mexican factory workers who had gone on strike, 1892. 

The government is not indifferent to the evils afflicting the working class of the Republic: if their wages are 
inadequate or if they lack employment, the first one to regret this situation is the president. However, these 
are private ills that fall largely beyond the government’s power to correct. Such is the case, unfortunately, of 
the problems that afflict the working class that you so honorably represent. 

Given the laws that govern our country, the government cannot restrict the freedom of factory owners to fire 
or hire workers, nor can it intervene directly in the improvement of basic working conditions. No laws permit 
this nor do any economic interests oblige the government to dictate salaries, or prices, or working hours. 

In your demands, you invoke the right to work. But this right also implies the obligation to find jobs. It 
cannot be the government’s responsibility to supply workers with jobs, or to compel anyone else to supply 
them. Labor is subject, by unavoidable natural phenomena, to the law of supply and demand.

Source: José Francisco Godoy, Mexican consul in New York City, toast at a banquet given by the New York 
Chamber of Commerce in celebration of the good business relationship between Mexico and the United 
States, The Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City, 1908. 

Gentlemen, if we compare the Mexico of today with the Mexico of thirty years ago, the justice and the 
administrative abilities of our President Porfirio Díaz become apparent (applause). In the Mexico of today 
peace and tranquility reign supreme through the land, public education has made great progress, sanitary 
regulations are strictly adhered to, railways have been built, and public safety and the rights of foreigners (as 
well as of Mexicans) are rigidly safeguarded. The [United States] Department of Commerce and Labor 
recently praised the leaders of the Mexican Republic who, “realizing the necessity for outside aid in 
developing the natural resources of their country, have wisely framed such laws as are required to guarantee 
the commercial, financial, and industrial interests of [American] businesses and have thereby achieved the 
constant increase of foreign capital invested in Mexico.” 

All that I have said is sufficient to demonstrate the flourishing condition of Mexico and that we Mexicans, by 
placing General Díaz at the head of the administration of our country have, as you say, “the right man, in the 
right place, at the right time.” (applause)

Porfirio Díaz regime, Barbarous Mexico, travelogue published in Chicago, 1910. 

Slavery in Mexico! Yes, I found it. I found it first in Yucatan. The climate of northern Yucatan happens to be 
perfectly adapted to the production of henequen.* Here we find vast henequen plantations extending for 
miles and miles. The owners of these great plantations are the chief slave-holders of Yucatan and the 
plantation workers are the slaves. The slaves are 8,000 Yaqui Indians imported from Northern Mexico, 3,000 
Chinese and Koreans, and between 100,000 and 125,000 native Mayas, who formerly owned the lands that 
the henequen planters now own. 

The planters do not call their workers “slaves” especially when speaking to strangers. They do not call their 
system slavery; they call it enforced service for debt. At first I thought it would not be so bad if the servant 
had an opportunity of buying back his freedom. But I found that such was not the custom. “You need have no 
fear in purchasing this plantation,” one owner said to me, “of the laborers being able to buy their freedom and 
leave you. They can never do that.” “It is very easy to recruit workers,” another planter told me. “All that is 
necessary is that you get some free laborer in debt to you, and then you have him. We are always getting new 
laborers in that way.”

Source: Ricardo Flores Magón, Mexican intellectual and social reform activist of Native American ethnicity, 
“The Right of Property,” editorial published in the revolutionary newspaper Regeneración (Rebirth), March, 
1911. 

The right of property is an absurd right because it had its origins in crime, fraud, and abuse of power. In the 
past, land was worked in common, forests provided firewood to the hearths of all, harvests were distributed 
among the members of the community according to their needs. In Mexico, this custom thrived in indigenous 
communities in the era of Spanish domination and existed until recently. The attempt to take away the 
common lands of indigenous communities caused the recent Yaqui Wars in Sonora and the troubles with the 
Mayas in the Yucatan. 

The return of the land to the peasants should be accomplished during the present uprising. We revolutionaries 
will not be committing a crime by turning over the land to the working people, because, by natural law, it 
already belongs to them. It is the land that their ancestors watered with their sweat; the land that the 
Spaniards robbed by force from our Indian fathers. That land belongs to all Mexicans. Some of those who 
own the land currently might have bought it; others might have acquired the land by taking advantage of their 
friendship with corrupt government officials. Others still acquired the land by giving loans with high interest 
to the small indigenous farmers, forcing them to leave the land because they could not repay the debt.

Source: Anonymous author, “The Death of Emiliano Zapata,” a corrido* folk song lyrics, 1919. 

Listen, dear sirs, to the corrido relating a sad event; 
For Zapata, the great insurgent has been killed. 

The good Emiliano who loved the poor and wanted to give them freedom; 
for this the Indians of the villages joined him in his fight. 

Zapata was born among the poor, lived among the poor, and fought for the poor. 
“I don’t want riches, I don’t want honors,” he said to all. 

Mister Zapata, terror of the gachupines** has died! 
Where is our leader Zapata who was the punishment of the rich? 

He said to his followers: “When I am dead, fight to defend your communal lands, like a man should!” 
He said to his loyal assistant: “As long as I am alive, the Indians will be the owners of their land.” 

Little stream, what did the flowers tell you? 
“They said that Zapata is not dead, and that he will return.” 

*During the Revolution, corridos were popular songs on current social or political issues, whose lyrics were 
printed in pamphlet form and either sold or distributed for free by politicians or interest groups. 

**a derogatory term for Mexicans of European ancestry
