In part A students were asked to identify one economic \ndevelopment that supported the author\u2019s argument about Old-World integration. In part B the students were \nasked to explain how one piece of evidence challenged the notion that Mongol expansion marked a new era. \nFinally, in part C students were asked to explain how one intercultural transfer or exchange resulted from \nMongol conquests. This question primarily addressed Topics 2.1, 2.2, and 2.5 of the AP World History: \nModern Course and Exam Description. \n\nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the \nresponses integrate the skills required on this question? \n\nResponses generally demonstrated their knowledge of the role of the Mongols in economic developments that \nconnected the pre-modern (1200\u20131450) world, as well as the transfers/exchanges that resulted from these \nconquests. For many students, the Mongols, Silk Road trade, and other aspects of transregional trade during \nthis era are aspects of the course that they understand and could identify. Many students recognized the role \nthe Mongols played in securing, protecting, and promoting economic interactions in Eurasia. Many students \ncredited early modern gunpowder empires, such as the Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, Qing, etc., for European \nmaritime states as the architects of the \u201cnew era\u201d rather than the Mongols.  \n\nStudents were also able to demonstrate their ability to analyze arguments and claims in a secondary source. \nStudents had to know what Biran meant when mentioning the Mongol\u2019s role in \u201cintegration of the old world\u201d \nand \u201cthe first chapter of a new era.\u201d With an understanding of his claims, students had to be able to show how \nevidence and examples might support or challenge these claims. Student response generally demonstrated \nstrong understanding of the arguments and evidence to support.  \n\nWhat common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this \nquestion? \n\nResponses commonly introduced cultural rather than economic developments noting a common \nmisconception between the difference of these categories of analysis.

Part C asked for an explanation of how the transfer of crops and/or animals \nwould impact the environment. \n\nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the \nresponses integrate the skills required on this question? \n\nResponses were successfully able to identify many relevant navigational technologies as developments that \ncontributed to the Columbian Exchange including but not limited to lateen sails, the compass, and the \ncaravel. Teachers are clearly teaching the Columbian Exchange and students understand its impact. \nStudents were also able to identify the positive effects the exchange of new crops would have on people in \nthe Americas and in Europe as they improved nutrition, which led to healthier longer lives in addition to \nincreases in population size throughout Afro-Eurasia. Many students were also able to explain the \nenvironmental impacts the transfer of crops and/or domesticated animals would have, though these \nresponses were typically limited to the Americas and focused on the effects intensive agriculture would \nhave on the environment. \n\nWhat common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this \nquestion? \n\nStudent responses were very strong for this question. However, when there were misconceptions or gaps in \nknowledge there were a few patterns. For part A responses were unsuccessful when they used generalized \nphrases like \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cfaster\u201d to describe ships instead of identifying specific developments like the \ncompass or astrolabe. One of the more common problems for part B was responses that lacked the \u201cbenefit\u201d \naspect of the question. These responses would identify something historically accurate but not necessarily a \n\u201cbenefit.\u201d For example identifying \u201cmore food\u201d as opposed to \u201cmore production of food, which led to \npopulation growth.\u201d One of the common issues with part C was students would often overlook the \nenvironmental component of the question and/or not address how the environmental impact was a product \nof the transfer of crops and/or domesticated animals. \n\nCommon Misconceptions/Knowledge Gaps  Responses that Demonstrate Understanding  \n\n\u2022  \u201cShipping improved and allowed \n\n\u2022  \u201cOne of the developments that \n\nEuropeans to sail to the Americas.\u201d \n(Too general) \n\ncontributed to the Columbian Exchange \nwas the use of caravels with triangular \nsails.\u201d \n\n\u00a9 2022 College Board.  \nVisit College Board on the web: collegeboard.org. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f\u2022  \u201cOne of the effects of the transfer of \ncrops to the Americas was the use of \nthe encomienda system and natives \nworking on fields.\u201d (does not address \nan environmental effect of the transfer \nof crops) \n\n\u2022  \u201cBecause of the establishment of sugar \nplantations in the Americas and the use \nof intensive farming techniques to grow \nsugar there was a depletion of nutrients \nin the soil.\u201d \n\nBased on your experience at the AP\u00ae Reading with student responses, what advice would you offer \nteachers to help them improve the student performance on the exam? \n\nWhile students performed well on this question, many student responses failed to explain the effect crops \nand/or domesticated animals had on the environment and instead identified the effect on the environment. \nTaking the A.C.E.

Part B required an explanation of how the innovations of the Green Revolution benefited \npopulations in the developing world. Part C required responses that explained how the Green Revolution \nimpacted the environment within the developing world. \n\nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the \nresponses integrate the skills required on this question? \n\nStudents who chose to respond to this question were able to identify many scientific and technological \nadvances from the Green Revolution. The majority of the responses were relatively successful at connecting \nthe content from the CED for this time period by identifying GMO\u2019s, chemical fertilizers, and new crop \nvarieties as technological innovations of the Green Revolution, as well as increased crop availability as a \nbenefit to the populations of the developing world. \n\nThis question provided the opportunity for students to demonstrate their ability to use historical causation \nwhen they responded to how the Green Revolution benefited populations and how the Green Revolution \naffected the environment. While students were often able to identify a food surplus as a benefit of the Green \nRevolution, on occasion they fell short of being able to connect it to how that surplus impacted populations \nof the developing world. In addition, many students could identify pollution as having a negative impact on \nthe environment but did not fully explain how it was the result of the Green Revolution.  \n\nWhat common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this \nquestion? \n\nOne of the biggest gaps in knowledge was the idea that the Green Revolution and the Industrial Revolution \nwere one in the same.

The \nquestion was open geographically to allow responses from multiple areas with a specific tie to the period \n1450\u20131750. Students were able to interpret the terms \u201cconflict and conquest\u201d in a variety of ways, including \neconomic conquest and intellectual conflict. The question was designed to allow students to demonstrate their \nunderstanding of the factors that led to the significant changes in world religions within this time period. \nStudents were expected to present a historically defensible thesis, describe a historical context relevant to the \nprompt, use at least two specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt, use that evidence to \nsupport an argument in response to the prompt, use historical reasoning skills to frame or structure their \nargument, and demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the \nprompt. Successful responses compared religious change in different areas, explained causes for religious \nchange, or discussed how religious changes continued and ended across the periods. \n\nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the \nresponses integrate the skills required on this question? \n\nStudents who successfully answered this question demonstrated a wide range of knowledge on the causes \nand processes of religious development in this time period. The largest number of students on the operational \nexam selected this question, which typically means that students felt confident with some knowledge of the \nperiod or subject. Essays mostly addressed Spanish conquest of the Americas as a key example of military \nforce as a cause for religious change and typically responded with specific information tied to the arrival of \nconquistadors leading to the forced conversion of indigenous peoples to Catholicism. Another significant \nresponse path was an exploration of the Ottoman Empire, with frequent references to Janissaries as an \nexample of force being used to change the practice of religion even under a generally tolerant government, or \ndiscussion of the conflict between Safavid and Ottoman reflecting how military conflict could both stem from \nand reaffirm religious divides. Students were generally successful in creating a thesis/claim for their \nargument, though these claims were sometimes vague or lacked a line of reasoning. Teachers have done an \nadmirable job of introducing students to significant religious changes identified in the AP World History: \nModern framework and Topic 3.3.  \n\nWhat common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this \nquestion? \n\nStudents struggled slightly with deploying evidence in a way that supported their argument. Many essays \npresented a summary of religious knowledge or a vague response about the importance of religion without \naddressing the factors that lead to emergence, spread, or change.

How well did the \nresponses integrate the skills required on this question? \n\nResponses generally demonstrated some understanding of economic changes due to the exposure to free-\nmarket ideas. Many successful responses addressed economic changes in China and/or the USSR. \nTeachers are clearly effectively introducing the concepts of globalization and multinational corporations as \nstudents frequently included these in their discussions of late-twentieth century economic developments. \nMany of the highest scoring responses addressed neocolonialism and the exploitation of the developing \nworld as examples of negative consequences of exposure to free-market ideas as well as the practice of \noutsourcing labor to the developing world as part of globalization. A high percentage of students were \nsuccessful in demonstrating their ability to write a thesis or claim relevant to the prompt. \n\nFrequently mentioned changes included the opening up of markets in China/USSR, and increased trade, \nespecially in the previously addressed regions. Many students were successful in identifying context for the \nquestion, especially if they were able to accurately detail the economic differences between communism and \ncapitalism. \n\nResponses at times were not awarded points because the information provided was too vague. While they \nmight successfully utilize a historical reasoning skill to explain how the spread of free-market ideas led to \neconomic changes, they at times did not provide enough detail to provide strong evidence. In this essay, \nstudents who selected the question were more commonly than expected able to attain complexity. Many \nresponses earned this point by providing complex and nuanced understandings of the way in which \noutsourcing, expansion of multinational corporations, and other global economic developments impacted \nthe economies of developing and developed countries differently. Students that were able to draw in this \ntype of nuanced response of the changes that occurred did well overall on the essay. \n\n\u00a9 2022 College Board.  \nVisit College Board on the web: collegeboard.org. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fWhat common student misconceptions or gaps in knowledge were seen in the responses to this \nquestion? \n\nChronology was again a common problem with responses as students provided answers with discussions of \nthe early 20th century, the Industrial Revolution, or responding from a perspective of contemporary responses \nto global economic developments. Some responses also discussed the geo-political aspects of the Cold War \nwithout discussing the economy. Many students attempted to earn the contextualization but did not connect \nideas from hundreds of years ago directly with the late-20th century developments. Specific evidence for the \nprompt was often lacking\u2014understanding broad context but not deploying anything specific to support an \nargument.
